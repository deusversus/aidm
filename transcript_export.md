## 🔀 A Legendary Fusion: Solo Leveling x Cowboy Bebop

Excellent choices! Blending the high-stakes, RPG-progression of **Solo Leveling** with the gritty, jazz-infused space-noir of **Cowboy Bebop** creates a fascinating universe. Let's calibrate how these two worlds collide.

---

### 💡 Possible Blend Scenarios:

1. **Bounty Hunters of the Gates:** The Solar System is connected by Warp Gates, but some lead to Dungeons instead of planets. Hunters like Spike or Jet now clear these 'Ranks' to collect essence stones and bounties on interdimensional monsters.

2. **The Shadow Syndicate:** In the underworld of Mars and Ganymede, a new power has emerged—the ability to 'Arise' fallen foes. You are a bounty hunter who has awakened to a System that no one else can see, navigating a world of jazz, cigarettes, and shadow soldiers.

3. **Astral Gate Incident 2.0:** The gate accident didn't just break the moon; it tore a hole into the Monarchs' realm. Now, the ISS (Inter-Solar System) Police struggles to manage 'Awakened' criminals who use magic instead of zip-guns.

---

### ⚔️ Power System Question:

How should abilities work in this space-faring world?

- **Grounded Tech + Magic:** You use classic Bebop-style gadgets and ships, but your 'System' provides supernatural physical buffs and shadow summons.
- **Full RPG Integration:** The entire Solar System is governed by Ranks (E to S). Ships have stats, and space combat is as much about mana management as it is about piloting.
- **The Lone Outlier:** You are the ONLY one with Solo Leveling-style powers in a world that otherwise relies on technology and grit.

---

**What's YOUR vision for this blend?** Pick a scenario above, describe your own, or tell me which power approach you prefer!

solo leveling x cowboy bebop

#### 🎭 DM (Message 3)

## 🔀 Interesting Blend Request!

**Solo Leveling** meets **Cowboy Bebop** — that is an incredible aesthetic! We're talking high-stakes dungeon crawling across the stars with a lo-fi, jazzy atmosphere. Let's see how these worlds collide...

---

### 💡 Possible Blend Scenarios:

1. **Bounty Hunters of the Gates:** Gates don't just appear on Earth; they open on Mars, Venus, and the asteroid belt. Hunters are the new 'Cowboys,' traveling in beat-up spaceships to clear dungeons for Essence Stones—the only fuel left in the solar system.

2. **The Syndicate's Shadows:** The Red Dragon Crime Syndicate has discovered a way to 'Awaken' their enforcers. You play a lone wolf bounty hunter who accidentally stumbles into a 'Double Dungeon' on a derelict moon and gains a unique 'System' that no one else has.

3. **Jazz, Blues, and Necromancy:** The gritty, noir vibe of the Bebop crew, but instead of just pistols and kung-fu, the underworld is run by S-Rank mages. You're trying to make a living in a galaxy where the gap between the 'Awakened' elite and the 'Unawakened' poor is wider than ever.

---

### ⚔️ Power System Question:

How should abilities work in this sci-fi world?

- **The System in Space:** You are the only one with a 'Game System' interface, while everyone else uses traditional magic or high-tech weaponry.
- **Techno-Magic:** Magic and technology are fused. 'Gates' are spatial anomalies, and 'Mana' is treated like a radioactive resource used in cybernetics.
- **Classic Hybrid:** The 'System' and 'Awakening' exist exactly as in Solo Leveling, but the setting is the colonized solar system of Cowboy Bebop.

---

**What's YOUR vision for this blend?** Pick a scenario above, describe your own, or tell me how you want the power system to feel!

#### 🎮 Player (Message 4)

A mix of 1 and 3. Gates appear throughout the solar system, and the real commodity is the Gates themselves. More than one gate can lead to any given Dungeon, so the Gates & and Dungeons become a mode of interstellar logistics. Combine that with the naturally resource rich nature of the Dungeons, rare and unique raw materials and magical artifacts alike, the Gatekeepers Guild (in charge of the logistics network that underpins interstellar trade) and the Adventurer's Guild (in charge of Dungeon clearing and Hunter organization; logistical dungeons must be cleared periodically to maintain "shipping lanes") That get's us to the gritty noir vibes where the awakened elite live on a different social stratus than the Unawakened plebs. 

Power system is the Classic Hybrid.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 5)

## 🌌 Calibrating the Universe

That is master-level world-building! Using Dungeons as **interstellar shipping lanes** adds a perfect layer of gritty corporate noir to the high-fantasy stakes of Solo Leveling. The tension between the **Gatekeepers Guild** and the **Adventurer's Guild** creates a fantastic political landscape where the 'shipping lanes' must be cleared or the economy collapses.

---

### 👥 The Cast and Timeline

Since we are blending two distinct universes, we need to decide how the 'legends' of these worlds fit into your story.

1. **The Legends Exist (Full Cast):** Characters like **Spike Spiegel** or **Sung Jin-woo** are active in this world. You might cross paths with the Bebop crew at a space-station bar or see news of the 'Shadow Monarch' on the Martian feeds.

2. **The Legends are History (Legacy):** They existed once, but their stories are over. You are living in the world they left behind, perhaps dealing with the power vacuum left by the Monarchs or the fall of the Red Dragon Syndicate.

3. **Inspired Universe (Fresh Start):** The *rules* of Solo Leveling and the *vibe* of Cowboy Bebop exist, but the specific characters do not. This is entirely your story, with your own rivals and icons.

---

### 📅 Impact on History

How much power do you have to change the 'canon' of this world?

- **Observable:** The major events of the solar system happen regardless of your actions. You're just trying to survive the 'shipping lane' collapses.
- **Influenceable:** Your actions could prevent a Gate break on Ganymede or dismantle a corrupt branch of the Gatekeepers Guild.

---

**How should the original characters and history factor into your journey?**

#### 🎮 Player (Message 6)

3, you can easter egg a character in here or there as a alt-world cameo or something, but the story is largely just going to be our own.

It's an alt-world, so the canon is more "inform the style" instead of "historic fact"

#### 🎭 DM (Message 7)

## 🚀 Setting the Cosmic Stage

Understood! We are building a **Fresh Start** universe. This is a world where the rules of the System and the jazzy, gritty atmosphere of the solar system are the foundation, but the story belongs entirely to you.

I'll keep the 'legends' as distant echoes or clever easter eggs in the background while we focus on your rise through the shipping lanes.

---

### ⚡ Power Level Calibration

Before we dive into your character's concept, we need to determine your starting **Power Level**:

1. **OP Protagonist** — You are overwhelmingly powerful from the start.
   > *Tension comes from the burden of your strength, your relationships, or the moral weight of your choices—not whether you can win a fight.*

2. **Traditional Progression** — You start as a 'low-rank' hunter or a struggling freelancer.
   > *The classic hero's journey where you earn every level-up through blood, sweat, and close-call victories.*

---

**Which path resonates with your vision for this character?**

#### 🎮 Player (Message 8)

#### 🎭 DM (Message 9)

## 🎭 Phase 1: Character Concept

The "Zero to Hero" journey fits the gritty, noir atmosphere of this solar system perfectly. Starting from the bottom means every credit earned and every level gained will be hard-won against the backdrop of corporate guilds and dangerous shipping lanes.

Now that we've set the stage, it's time to define **YOU**.

---

### 💡 The Big Idea

What is the core concept of your character? Think of it as the tagline for your own anime series. 

**Examples for this world:**

> *"An E-Rank porter who survived a 'lane collapse' and now has a glitchy System interface that no one else can see."*

> *"A disgraced former pilot trying to pay off a massive debt to the Gatekeepers Guild by hunting in the most unstable Dungeons."*

> *"A tech-wizard who uses jury-rigged gear to mimic Awakened abilities, trying to prove that the Unawakened can still compete."*

---

**What's YOUR character's core concept?** Tell me the big idea that will drive your story!

#### 🎮 Player (Message 10)

An F-Rank Gofer (a name derived from their mundane job: "go for") known as the weakest in the Adventurer's guild (and the galaxy lol). Most places won't hire me, even as a lowly Gofer, being Unawakened is virtually unheard of in the guild. But I need the money to take care of my sick wife, so I risk it all everytime I step foot into a dungeon. I've almost died countless times, and only survive by being a strategic mastermind and walking encyclopedia of guild information. I know every monster every found, by name, their stats, what gates they appear in, weaknesses, ecology/taxonomy, lifecycle and common abilities, etc etc etc Any time Im not working I'm studying to keep myself alive.

(Eventually this will be my super power when I finally do awaken)

#### 🎭 DM (Message 11)

## 🎭 A Legend in the Making

The **"Weakest Gofer in the Galaxy"** is a quintessential starting point! It perfectly captures that *Cowboy Bebop* struggle for survival and the *Solo Leveling* underdog spirit.

Being an **Unawakened** human in a guild of super-powered elites, relying solely on your wits and a massive mental database of monster ecology, creates incredible tension. Your motivation—saving your sick wife—gives every dungeon run a heavy emotional weight.

---

### 👤 Phase 2: Identity

Let's put a face and a name to this strategic mastermind.

**1. What is your name?** (Does it sound like a gritty space-noir name or something more traditional?)

**2. Age & Appearance:** What do you see when you look in the cracked mirror of a space-station restroom?
> *Think about your build, hair, eyes, and any distinguishing marks (scars from close calls, a worn-out guild jumpsuit, etc.)*

**3. Personality & Quirks:** You're a walking encyclopedia—do you mutter stats under your breath during a fight? Are you cynical and world-weary, or desperately optimistic?

---

**Who is the person behind the "Gofer" title?** Tell me about your name and what you look like!

#### 🎮 Player (Message 12)

Kami Noteki

~23 years old, relatively unremarkable Japanese male; maybe a little underdeveloped for my age. tall, scrawny, handsome but in an understated and forgettable way

3) All of the above. I'm always muttering thoughts out loud, trying to do the math to stay alive. I'm internally pretty world-weary, but I try VERY HARD to stay prosocial and desparately optimistic because its the only way to keep on keeping on

#### 🎭 DM (Message 13)

## 🎭 The Face of the Underdog

**Kami Noteki.** It has a certain ring to it—the kind of name that doesn't demand attention in a room full of S-Rank giants, which is exactly how you've managed to survive this long. 

Your "understated and forgettable" look is your greatest shield. In the gritty space-ports and neon-lit guild halls, being the scrawny guy muttering math in the corner makes you invisible. But we know that behind those tired eyes is a mind calculating every variable to ensure you make it home.

---

### 📜 Deepening the Legend

To finish your **Identity**, we need to look at the heart of your struggle:

1. **The Motivation:** What is your wife's name, and what is the nature of her illness? Is it the "Eternal Sleep" caused by mana-exhaustion, or something more technological?

2. **The Catalyst:** You weren't born a walking encyclopedia. Was there a specific dungeon run where your lack of knowledge almost cost you everything? Tell me about that "Close Call."

3. **The Gear:** As an Unawakened Gofer, you don't have magic. Do you carry a specific piece of low-tech gear? A battered data-pad? A lucky (but empty) stim-pack?

---

**What are the details of your past and the person you're fighting for?**

#### 🎮 Player (Message 14)

Belial Noteki. They call it "Gate-rot", but no one knows what it is. It happens to 1:1000 people who enter the gates. There's no known marker or test other than entering a gate for the first time. She was going to be an adventurer. She was awakened. And TALENTED beyond imaging. But the moment she entered her first gate, she began to fade away as if her body couldn't hold itself together anymore. Like entropy was overtaking the structured process of "life". 

A A-rank medicine found in the gates can nullify it's effects, but it doesn't CURE it. The moment the medicines duration ends, the rot begins again. The same item is also known to fully cure many other ailments that are otherwise uncurable, like cancer and dementia. Because of this, it is both fairly rare and extremely in demand, causing it's price to inflate even above other A-rank products. 

This is why I work myself to the bone, working 365 days a year, multiple gate runs a day (they normally take about 4-6 hours each, most sucessful adventurers--even the ones grinding--don't do more than 1 gate a day with ample rest days like a normal work shift; high ranking adventurers work much less, and top ranked (A and S ranks) choose when they work like mogels and celebrities)

And I can barely keep up with the treatments. I sell plasma on the side, run an arbitrage business using info I learn from being in so many gates, and do consulting for gate-info planning for low ranking (F-D ranks) parties. All this just to live in a tiny studio apartment in a rundown asteroid at the fringe of the belt. ALL of my money goes to the Panacea that keeps Belial alive. 

2) Yeah, I got gored by a monster in a dungeon and was only saved because an A rank adventurer, a famous healer-type hunter known widely for her "warrior-monk" style of combat and for being one of the few successful combatant-healers. Her style became known as the "paladin" style of healer vs the original "cleric" style healer, revolutionizing how people interacted with their class. She's known to be chasing after an S-rank classification.  

Had she not been there, of all people in the solar system, I'd already be dead. I realized I'd not get a second chance at such a miracle, and that had I died my wife would have been left alone to rot. 

3) I have a whole kit. Adrenaline shots, healing herbs, and array of other preparedness items sorted into two categories: General Use and Mission Specific. I prep before each job based on my extensive knowledge. Simple tricks like keeping vials of the pee of a monster's natural predator can spare you from combat in the first place.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 15)

## 💊 The Weight of the Galaxy

**Belial Noteki** and the tragedy of **Gate-rot** add a profound, haunting layer to your story. The idea of 'entropy' overtaking life itself is a terrifying concept, and it perfectly explains why you are forced into the most grueling work schedule in the solar system. 

Your encounter with the **A-rank Paladin** was a true turning point. It's clear that while she saved your life, the realization of what your death would mean for Belial is what truly forged your resolve to become a walking encyclopedia of survival.

---

### 🎒 The Gofer's Kit

Your preparation is your only 'superpower' for now. Using predator pheromones and adrenaline shots to bridge the gap between human and Awakened is pure strategic brilliance. 

> *"Knowledge isn't just power here—it's the only thing keeping the Panacea flowing."*

---

## ⚡ Phase 3: Mechanical Build

Since you are **Unawakened**, your physical stats are grounded, but your mental acuity is off the charts. You have **75 points** to distribute (Min 5, Max 18).

Based on your description of a scrawny, brilliant mastermind, I suggest this spread:

| Attribute | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **STR** | 7 | Underdeveloped and scrawny |
| **DEX** | 13 | Quick reflexes from dodging goring monsters |
| **CON** | 7 | Fragile; you can't take many hits |
| **INT** | 18 | Your 'Strategic Mastermind' and database status |
| **WIS** | 18 | Incredible perception and tactical awareness |
| **CHA** | 12 | Your prosocial, optimistic effort to stay connected |

**Total: 75 Points**

---

**Does this stat spread feel right for Kami, or would you like to shift some points around?**

#### 🎮 Player (Message 16)

Let's lower CHA to 10 and put those 2 points in DEX.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 17)

## ⚙️ Refining the Machine

Stats updated! Increasing your **DEX** to 15 while keeping your **CHA** at a grounded 10 makes perfect sense for Kami. You aren't winning any popularity contests in the high-rank lounges, but you're fast enough to keep your head attached to your shoulders when a Gate-beast lunges.

---

### 🧠 Unique Ability: The Mastermind's Edge

Even as an **Unawakened**, your sheer dedication to study has granted you a 'pseudo-ability.' Let's define your signature trait:

**Tactical Encyclopedia:** You can spend a moment of observation to identify a monster's exact stats, weaknesses, and behavioral patterns. 

> *Example: "That's a Void-Stalker. Its chitin is weak to thermal fluctuations, and it always strikes from the left after its third chitter. We have 4.2 seconds to move."*

Does this sound like the right 'power' for your strategic mind, or do you have another name or function in mind for it?

---

### 🛠️ Skills & Equipment

You have **3 Skill Points** to assign to specialized areas (e.g., *First Aid, Piloting, Stealth, Monster Lore, Scavenging*). 

Additionally, let's finalize your **Gofer's Kit**. You mentioned predator pheromones and adrenaline. What is the one 'prized' piece of gear you never enter a gate without? Is it a custom-modded data-pad or perhaps a memento from Belial?

---

**How would you like to spend your 3 skill points, and what is your most vital piece of gear?**

#### 🎮 Player (Message 18)

Let's make the Unique Ability: Compounded Experience (Each EXP the user earns inside of a gate before being awakened by the system is multiplied exponentially by a multiplicative of the difference between their level and the enemy's level.)

Everything I've been doing has been counting toward my eventual awakening. Unawakened have access to the System's "Status" menu, but their class is "None" and their stats do not change. It is still policy, though unawakened working for the adventurer's guild is virtually unheard of, for ALL party member's to join the party via the Status menu; so I've been banking EXP for every dungeon I've been through. 

When I awaken, it'll be an OP mode enabling moment.

Skills: Dungeon Knowledge, Gate Knowledge, System Knowledge

Yeah, it's the holo-message she sent me before she went to work that morning. A simple "love you, have a good day, wish me luck!" and that smile that made me marry her. I carry it everywhere and play it often.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 19)

## 📈 The Banked Potential

**Compounded Experience** is a brilliant and high-stakes mechanical choice! It turns every second you spend as a 'weak' Gofer into a ticking time bomb of potential. While the elites look down on you for having a 'None' class, you are effectively building a mountain of power in the shadows.

Your skills—**Dungeon, Gate, and System Knowledge**—perfectly reflect a man who has replaced magical talent with pure, hard-earned data. And that holo-message from **Belial**? That's the most powerful item in your inventory. It's the 'why' that keeps you moving when your CON of 7 says you should have collapsed hours ago.

---

### ⚡ OP Configurations: The Awakening

Since you've confirmed this story leads to an **OP mode enabling moment**, we need to define what that 'Awakening' looks like when the banked EXP finally hits. 

Based on the *Solo Leveling × Cowboy Bebop* vibe, here are two ways your legend could explode:

**1. "The System Overload"** (T3)
- **Tension:** `consequence + relational` — Your power is so vast it threatens to burn out your unawakened body, and every use costs you time you could spend with Belial.
- **Expression:** `overwhelming + instantaneous` — When you finally 'click' into the system, you don't just level up; you rewrite the local reality of the Gate.
- **Focus:** `reverse_ensemble` — We see the shock and awe of the A-rank hunters who once ignored you as you suddenly outpace them.
> *Power: A literal 'glitch' in the galaxy's power scaling that makes you a one-man army.*

**2. "The Strategic Singularity"** (T4)
- **Tension:** `information + burden` — You see the 'code' of the universe now. The burden is knowing exactly how everything ends.
- **Expression:** `hidden + conditional` — You still look like a scrawny Gofer, but you can dismantle an S-Rank threat with a single, perfectly placed strike because you know their 'stats' better than they do.
- **Focus:** `internal + faction` — The story shifts to you managing the galactic guilds and the hunt for the Panacea from a position of absolute intellectual and physical dominance.
> *Power: God-tier tactical precognition and perfect execution.*

---

### 🌍 Phase 4: World Integration

While we keep that Awakening in our back pocket, we need to know where **Kami Noteki** is standing right now.

1. **Starting Location:** Which 'rundown asteroid at the fringe of the belt' do you call home? Does it have a name, or is it just a coordinate in the Gatekeeper's database?

2. **The Current Job:** You're working 365 days a year. What is the specific Gate you're about to enter? Is it a routine 'D-Rank' haul, or a risky 'C-Rank' solo run you took for the extra credits?

3. **The Healer's Shadow:** Does that A-rank Paladin who saved you know you're still alive? Do you ever cross paths with her in the Guild halls?

---

**Which OP Awakening resonates with you, and where exactly in the belt does your story begin?**

#### 🎮 Player (Message 20)

I'm thinking OP mode looks like unlocking the root account; the system administrator prompt. Progression looks like learning how to use it (sitting at a linux station isnt the same as known what to type into the console). Tension is about having the  power to do anything BUT save my wife (but this should be LONG TERM; season arc level) and immediate tension is the switch from nobody to "the one". Expression is overwhelming and instant. focus: ensemble (i want to make friends along the way and see how factions clamor to align with me) and reverse-ensemble (I draw the attention of the guilds and the guild's enemy's alike; showing them doing what they would normally do but being disrupted by the inexorability of me/protag (think OVERLORD)) 

starting location: it is "home" for now, but the home I shared with my wife is long gone, pawned off for her meds. she is in a specialized care facility in an A-rank facility getting system-class care; that's all that matters. Her being alive is home, or what makes the idea of "home" possible.

current job: E rank gate on the moon of mars

3) It's hard for ME to imagine she cared I existed, but only she (thus you) would know if I left any impact on her at all.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 21)

## 🖥️ The Root Administrator

Unlocking the **Root Account** of the universe... that is a terrifyingly cool concept. It fits the *Solo Leveling* system-logic while keeping the *Cowboy Bebop* "low-tech guy in a high-tech world" vibe. You aren't just getting stronger; you're gaining the ability to edit the source code of reality.

---

### 📊 Character Recap: Kami Noteki

**World:** Solo Leveling × Cowboy Bebop (The Belt)
**Name:** Kami Noteki
**Concept:** The Unawakened Admin
**Stats:** STR 7 | DEX 15 | CON 7 | INT 18 | WIS 18 | CHA 10
**Unique Ability:** Compounded Experience (Banking power for the 'Glitch')
**Motivation:** Saving Belial from the entropy of Gate-rot.

---

## Phase 5: Your Story Begins

> *The air on Phobos smells like stale copper and cheap industrial coolant. You stand in the shadow of a massive, rusted Gate-stabilizer, the purple swirl of the E-Rank portal reflecting in your tired eyes. Around you, a group of D-Rank 'professionals' are laughing, checking their mana-blades and energy shields. To them, you're just the pack-mule. The guy who carries the spare batteries and the monster-repellent.*
>
> *Your pocket vibrates. You pull out the battered comms-unit. It's the daily notification from the A-Rank Facility: "Payment processed. 23 hours of Panacea remaining."
>
> *You've done the math. This gate won't cover tomorrow's dose. You need a miracle, or you need to find something in there that the System hasn't accounted for yet. As the party leader—a loud-mouthed Tank with more ego than INT—signals the descent, your Status window flickers. For a split second, the "Class: None" text glitches into a command prompt.*
>
> `[sudo access requested...]` 

---

**The party steps into the shimmering void of the Gate. What is your first move as you cross the threshold?**

#### 🎮 Player (Message 22)

I've been in the Phobos dungeon a dozen times. It's a local-type dungeon, meaning it only has one gate leading to it, hence it's name. The Phobos gate leads to the Phobos dungeon. (Getting here requires shuttling from Mars proper, which has a number of non-local type dungeons which have multiple gates connecting to them (colloquially called "port gates") which are used for interstellar travel and logistics. Local gates are managed SOLELY by the AG (adventurer's guild), while port gates are under the primary jurisdiction of the Gate Guild.

I'm so tired, and my mind is focused on surviving the dungeon in one piece, I dont even notice the flicker. 

"Another day another dollar" i mutter as I enter the gate behind the party

#### 🎭 DM (Message 23)

### 🌑 Session 1: The Phobos Routine

The gate swallows you like it always does—cold first, then nothing, then everything.

The transition lasts exactly 3.7 seconds. You know this because you've counted it twelve times. The purple light peels away from your skin like static discharge, and then there it is: the **Phobos Dungeon**, laid out before you in all its underwhelming, E-Rank glory.

---

A cavern system. Bioluminescent fungal colonies clinging to the ceiling like a sick man's stars, casting everything in a blue-green wash that makes healthy people look dead and dead things look peaceful. The air is damp, metallic, warmer than the station outside. Thirty-two degrees Celsius, give or take. Optimal spawning temperature for **Chitin Crawlers**—the dungeon's most common mob. Territorial, insectoid, roughly the size of a large dog. Weak to blunt trauma and bright light. Retreat pattern: diagonal-left.

You know all of this the way most people know their own address.

---

The party fans out ahead of you without a backward glance. Four D-Rankers running an E-Rank dungeon for quick credits and easy System EXP—the adventurer equivalent of picking up loose change between couch cushions.

**Goro Senta**, the tank, cracks his neck and activates his mana-shield. A translucent blue hexagonal barrier flickers to life around his forearm. He's broad, loud, and has the tactical depth of a puddle on a hot day. But his shield can absorb a C-Rank hit, so parties tolerate him.

> *"Alright, same as last time. Clear the first three chambers, grab the loot nodes, and we're out in two hours. Gofer—"*

He doesn't use your name. None of them do.

> *"—stay behind the line and don't touch anything."*

---

**Reika**, the party's striker, twirls a mana-edged short sword between her fingers with practiced boredom. **Daisuke**, support-class, is already scrolling through his Status menu, optimizing his buff loadout for an enemy he could sneeze on. **Mori**, the scout, has already disappeared into the forward tunnel, her stealth skill rendering her a faint shimmer against the cavern wall.

They move like a machine. An inefficient, overpowered machine running at maybe thirty percent capacity for a dungeon that poses zero threat to any of them.

You adjust the straps of your pack. Forty-three kilograms of supplies, organized by category and sub-indexed by encounter probability. General Use: left compartments. Mission Specific: right compartments. The **Chitin Crawler pheromone vials**—harvested from the scent glands of a **Tunnel Raptor**, their only natural predator in this biome—are in the upper-right breast pocket. Easy access. Three-second deployment time.

You've never needed them in the Phobos Dungeon. But you carry them anyway, because *not carrying them* is how people end up as cautionary tales in the guild's quarterly safety briefings.

---

The first chamber opens up ahead. Standard layout. You've mapped it from memory—the loot nodes cluster near the northeastern fungal deposits, and the Crawlers will be nested in the ceiling hollows, agitated by the party's mana signatures.

Your legs ache. Your eyes sting. Somewhere in the back of your skull, a dull pressure has been building since this morning—since you read the notification. **23 hours of Panacea remaining.** The math runs itself whether you want it to or not: this run pays 12,000 credits. Tomorrow's dose costs 89,000. You're short. You're always short.

You reach into your jacket and press the holo-emitter. Just for a second. Just enough to see the flicker of her face, mid-laugh, mouth forming the words *wish me luck* before the image collapses back into your pocket.

Another day. Another dollar.

Behind you, unnoticed, the gate's surface ripples once—then twice—in a pattern that hasn't been observed in any recorded gate behavior across the entire solar system.

---

The first Crawlers drop from the ceiling with a wet *chittering* sound. Six of them. Textbook ambush pattern. **Goro** raises his shield and bellows something predictably stupid. **Reika** is already mid-swing.

From your position at the rear, you see everything. The formation gaps. Daisuke's buff timing slightly off—he's running a 0.4 second lag on his **Haste** cast because he didn't pre-load it. Mori is flanking too wide for a six-pack; she's positioned for an eight-pack spawn, which doesn't happen in this chamber.

None of it matters. They'll kill these things in under a minute. They don't need your knowledge here.

Nobody does.

---

But then **Mori's** voice crackles over the party comms, sharp and stripped of its usual cool:

> *"Contact. Chamber two. I'm reading... a lot more signatures than the mapping data says should be here."*

A pause.

> *"Gofer. How many Crawlers nest in the second chamber?"*

First time she's spoken to you directly in four runs.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The party is mid-combat with six Crawlers in Chamber One—a trivial fight. But Mori's scouting data suggests an anomaly in Chamber Two.

- **Answer immediately from memory** — You know this dungeon's population density by heart. Give her the exact number and flag what the discrepancy might mean.
- **Ask her for specifics first** — How many signatures? What formation? The answer changes depending on what she's seeing.
- **Stay quiet and check your own data** — Pull up your notes on your battered data-pad. Trust your records over your exhausted brain.

*She's waiting.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 24)

I answer immediately and confirm her suspicion of an anomaly.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 25)

### 🧠 The Encyclopedia Speaks

The number leaves your mouth before **Mori** finishes her sentence. Automatic. Mechanical. Like reading a serial number stamped into the back of your skull.

> *"Fourteen. Chamber Two nests fourteen Crawlers. Two clusters of five along the upper eastern wall, a patrol group of four that cycles between the northern fungal column and the drainage fissure on a nine-minute loop."*

Your voice is flat. Tired. The voice of a man reciting his own address.

> *"If you're reading more than fourteen, something's wrong."*

---

Static on the comms. The wet crunch of **Reika** bisecting a Crawler behind you barely registers. Background noise. Elevator music.

> *"I'm reading thirty-one,"* **Mori** says. Quiet now. The professional cool is back, but there's a tightness underneath it—the sound of someone who just realized the easy paycheck might have teeth. *"Possibly more. Some signatures are... overlapping. Hard to separate."*

Thirty-one.

Your mind does what it always does. It runs.

Fourteen is the population ceiling for Chamber Two. Has been across all twelve of your runs. E-Rank local dungeons don't fluctuate—their ecosystems are closed loops, self-regulating, predictable as tide tables. **Phobos** hasn't had a population deviation greater than two in the eighteen months since its discovery. You know this because you've cross-referenced the guild's bimonthly ecology reports with your own field observations. Every. Single. Time.

Thirty-one isn't a fluctuation. Thirty-one is a **rupture**.

---

> *"Gofer? You still there?"*

> *"The population cap for this dungeon is fourteen per chamber. Seventeen total across Chambers Two and Three during peak spawning, which isn't for another six weeks."*

You're walking forward now. Not toward the fight—the fight is already over, **Goro** is laughing about something, **Daisuke** is tabulating EXP with a bored expression—but toward the tunnel mouth leading to Chamber Two. Your hand finds the breast pocket. The pheromone vials. You don't pull them out yet. Just confirm they're there.

> *"Thirty-one signatures means one of two things. Either the dungeon's ecology has destabilized—which doesn't happen in local-types without an external catalyst—or those aren't all Crawlers."*

A beat.

> *"Mori. Are the overlapping signatures the same size?"*

---

Another pause. Longer this time. You hear the faint hum of her scanner recalibrating.

> *"...No."* Her voice drops half a register. *"Some of them are bigger. A lot bigger."*

The party behind you has gone quiet. **Goro's** laugh dies in his throat. You can feel them looking at you now—actually *looking*—for what might be the first time in four runs. The Gofer. The pack-mule. The guy who carries the spare batteries.

The guy who just became the only person in the room who understands what's happening.

Your exhausted brain catalogs the possibilities in order of probability. Population bloom without ecological trigger: impossible. Cross-chamber migration: accounts for maybe eighteen, not thirty-one. Dungeon mutation event: astronomically rare in E-Ranks, but not *zero*. External intrusion from a connected system—

**Phobos is a local-type dungeon.** It has one gate. One entrance. One exit. There *is* no connected system.

Unless something connected to it from the other side.

---

The fungal light on the cavern ceiling flickers. Just once. Just enough for you to notice.

Behind you—far behind you, back at the gate threshold you crossed three minutes ago—the air tastes different. Colder. Like the temperature dropped two degrees in a space that should be holding steady at thirty-two.

Your Status window sits dormant in the corner of your vision. **Class: None.** Same as always.

Same as always.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The party is looking at you. **Mori** is holding position in the forward tunnel. The anomaly in Chamber Two isn't going anywhere—but the signatures aren't moving toward you either. Yet.

- **Brief the party** — Lay out what you know, what you don't, and recommend a course of action. They might actually listen for once.
- **Recommend immediate withdrawal** — Thirty-one unknowns with larger signatures in an E-Rank dungeon screams above your pay grade. Get out, report to the Guild, let someone with a rank handle it.
- **Move to the tunnel yourself** — You need eyes on Chamber Two. Your knowledge is useless without visual confirmation of what those larger signatures are.

*Goro is staring at you. Waiting. He won't admit it, but he doesn't know what to do.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 26)

We need to withdraw, but it's too late. I scream for Mori to pullback. 

They're not going to wait either. We need to regroup into a defensive phalanx immediately. This is a trap. The only thing that makes sense isn't that there are too many signatures, it's that there's not enough. Meaning the rest are concealed--waiting for us to approach the second chamber to close the pincer attack. 

We're already surrounded.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 27)

### ⚡ The Gofer's Command

The scream tears out of your throat before your brain finishes the thought. Raw. Ragged. A sound that doesn't belong to the quiet guy in the back with the pack full of monster piss.

> *"MORI! PULL BACK NOW!"*

Your voice cracks on the last word. Doesn't matter. The frequency of genuine terror is universal—it cuts through bravado, through ego, through the comfortable haze of running an E-Rank dungeon on autopilot. **Mori's** shimmer freezes in the tunnel mouth.

You're already spinning toward the rest of them. **Goro** has his shield down, laughing at the bisected Crawler at his feet. **Reika** is flicking ichor off her blade with the disinterested grace of someone cleaning lint from a sleeve. **Daisuke** is mid-yawn.

> *"PHALANX! NOW! BACKS TOGETHER!"*

---

**Goro** stares at you. His mouth opens—and you can see it forming, the sneer, the dismissal, the *who the hell do you think you're talking to, Gofer—*

> *"They're not bunched in Chamber Two because they migrated there. They're bunched because they LEFT HERE."*

The words land like a slap.

> *"This chamber should have six Crawlers. We killed six Crawlers. But this chamber* ***supports*** *twelve. Where are the other six, Goro?"*

---

His eyes widen.

The bioluminescent fungus on the ceiling flickers—not randomly this time, but in sequence, a wave of darkening blue-green rolling from the tunnel behind you toward the chamber entrance ahead. Like something large is passing between the colonies, disturbing them. Something on the ceiling.

Something that's been on the ceiling the entire time.

---

**Goro** moves. Credit where it's due—the man is an idiot, but his body knows what a threat response feels like. His mana-shield blazes to life, hexagonal plates of blue light snapping into place as he plants himself at center mass. **Reika** drops low, blade angled, eyes scanning upward for the first time since entering the dungeon. **Daisuke's** hands are already weaving—**Haste**, **Barrier**, **Sensory Boost**—three buffs in rapid succession, no lag this time. Fear is a wonderful optimizer.

**Mori** materializes beside you in a blur of displaced air, her stealth dropping like a shed skin. Her scanner is out. Her jaw is tight.

> *"They're above us,"* she says. Not a question.

> *"And behind us,"* you say. *"And in the tunnel ahead. The ones in Chamber Two aren't advancing because they don't need to. They're the anvil. We walked into the hammer."*

---

The first sound is a wet, clicking trill—higher pitched than a standard Crawler. Faster. A staccato rhythm that bounces off the cavern walls until it's impossible to tell direction. Then another joins it. Then six more. Then a sound you've never heard in this dungeon. A deep, resonant **thrumming**, like a bass string plucked inside a cathedral. It vibrates in your molars. In your ribs.

The fungal light dies. All of it. At once.

Darkness. Total. The kind that has weight.

---

**Daisuke's** Sensory Boost flares—a ring of pale gold light expanding from his position, illuminating a ten-meter radius in sickly amber. And in that light, you see them.

**Chitin Crawlers** cling to every surface. Ceiling. Walls. The tunnel behind you, packed so tight their legs overlap. Dozens. Their compound eyes catch the light like wet gravel. But they aren't moving. They're *waiting*—locked in a rigid, geometric formation that no E-Rank mob should be capable of. Coordinated. Organized.

**Commanded.**

And at the center of the ceiling, directly above the party, something that is decidedly *not* a Chitin Crawler unfolds.

---

It's the size of a shuttle. Matte-black chitin plates layered like feudal armor. Six limbs—four anchored to the rock, two held forward, each terminating in a curved blade of bone that gleams faintly with something that isn't bioluminescence. It's darker. A light that *subtracts*. Its head—if you can call it that—is a smooth, featureless dome split by a single horizontal fissure that pulses with that deep, resonant **thrumming**.

Your mind races through every bestiary entry, every guild report, every whispered rumor in every gate-hall you've ever haunted.

Nothing. You've got **nothing.**

This thing isn't in any database. It doesn't belong in an E-Rank dungeon. It doesn't belong in *any* ranked dungeon you've ever studied.

For the first time in years, **Kami Noteki** doesn't have an answer.

---

**Goro's** shield arm is shaking. The blue hexagons stutter, destabilize, restabilize. His face in the amber light has lost all its color.

> *"Gofer..."* His voice is small. A child's voice from a big man's body. *"...what is that?"*

The phalanx holds. Four D-Rankers and one Unawakened, backs together, surrounded on all sides by a swarm that shouldn't exist, beneath a creature that shouldn't be here, in a dungeon that has apparently stopped following its own rules.

Your hand is in your breast pocket. The pheromone vials press against your fingers. Useless. You designed them for Chitin Crawlers. Whatever that thing on the ceiling is, it isn't a Crawler, and you'd bet your last credit the Crawlers are more afraid of *it* than they'd ever be of a Tunnel Raptor's scent.

Twenty-two hours of Panacea remaining. Give or take.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The phalanx is holding, but the swarm hasn't attacked. The entity on the ceiling is watching—or whatever that pulsing fissure does instead of watching. You're in a pocket of light surrounded by darkness and chitin.

- **Talk to it** — It's commanding the swarm. That implies intelligence. Intelligence implies communication. It's the longest shot you've ever taken, but you're out of short ones.
- **Assess escape routes** — The gate is behind you, past the tunnel packed with Crawlers. Can the party cut through before the ceiling-thing reacts?
- **Provoke Goro into action** — He's the tank. His shield is the only thing rated above E-Rank here. If anyone can buy time, it's him—but he needs someone to tell him what to do. He needs *you* to tell him what to do.
- **Stay perfectly still and observe** — It hasn't attacked. *Why hasn't it attacked?* There's data here. There's always data.

*The thrumming deepens. The fissure in the creature's dome widens by a centimeter. Somewhere behind you, a Crawler shifts its weight.*

*Twenty-two hours.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 28)

I've already observed. I've been observing. The math already fell into place. The problem isn't thinking, it's that the math isn't on our side. 

Mutations aren't unheard of, they're just not in local gates. They normally happen from the invasive species and customs import check failures. Dungeon ecology mixes and creates... fucking problems. That shoudn't be possible in a local gate. 

There's only one answer. One possible variable that fixes the equation. It's honestly so simple a child could see it, if they weren't blinded by the hubris of knowledge and experience:

This ISN'T a local dungeon. It never was. We just never found the other gate. 

The mutation means someone or something else did--they used the other unregistered gate, and in the process, caused this chitin mutation. 

With the entrance blocked, our only option is forward. 

I provoke Goro into action, even as I'm yelling instrucitons to him, the plan is falling into place: We'll use the other gate. We don't know where it goes--the dangers of unregistered gates are well known. While many gates lead to locations in the solar system, some lead to places colloquially called "The Colonies"--places beyond the solar system. Links to deep space, other stars in the galaxy, and a few to--though its still speculated--possibly even other galaxies. The Colonies are dangerous places with dangerous forms of life. They are outside of the Guild's control, they police access but have little to do with what goes on on the otherside--leading to the Colonies being xenomorphic wastelands on the outskirts of space. Home to opportunistis, refugees, people hiding, criminals, freaks, and the whole works. 

And unregistered colony would be the work possible outcome, but the most likely--since if the gate lead to somewhere in the system, we'd already have found it's partner gate. 

Still, it's our only option.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 29)

### 🕳️ The Variable No One Checked

The math was never wrong. The math is never wrong. That's the one thing you've staked your life on every single day for years—that if you feed the equation enough data, reality has no choice but to confess.

And right now, reality is confessing something that should have been obvious from the start.

---

Your voice comes out low. Not a scream this time. Something worse. The calm, clipped cadence of a man who's already accepted the answer and is just waiting for everyone else to catch up.

> *"This isn't a local dungeon."*

**Goro** blinks. His shield arm trembles—blue hexagons stuttering like a dying fluorescent light.

> *"What?"*

> *"Chitin mutations require cross-biome contamination. Foreign organisms introduced into a closed ecology. That doesn't happen in local gates because local gates have ONE entrance. One exit. Sealed systems."*

You're not looking at **Goro**. You're looking at the thing on the ceiling. The matte-black god of this cavern, folded against the rock like origami made of war. Its fissure pulses. The thrumming rattles the fillings in your back teeth.

> *"Except this isn't a sealed system. It never was. Somewhere deeper in this dungeon, there's a second gate. Unregistered. Unmapped. Something came through it, and whatever it brought with it turned the local Crawlers into—"*

You gesture at the geometric swarm. Dozens of compound eyes. Perfect formation. Soldiers awaiting orders from the thing that shouldn't exist.

> *"—this."*

---

Silence. The kind that has mass. **Reika's** blade hangs at her side, the mana-edge guttering. **Daisuke's** buff aura flickers—his concentration is fracturing, and when a support-class loses focus, everyone feels it. The amber light dims by ten percent.

**Mori** speaks first. Quiet. Surgical.

> *"If there's a second gate, where does it lead?"*

> *"If it connected to anywhere in the system, the Guild would have found the partner gate during standard registration sweeps. They didn't. Which means it connects to somewhere outside the system."*

The word lands like a coffin nail.

> *"A Colony."*

---

**Goro's** face cycles through five emotions in two seconds. Confusion. Denial. Fear. Rage. And finally—*finally*—the one you need: the animal desperation of a man who understands he's in a box and the box is getting smaller.

> *"You're telling me there's a fucking COLONY GATE in an E-Rank dungeon on Phobos?!"*

> *"I'm telling you the tunnel behind us is packed with sixty-plus Crawlers in a kill formation commanded by something that isn't in any bestiary ever published. I'm telling you the entrance gate is on the other side of that wall of chitin. And I'm telling you the ONLY other exit is forward, through Chamber Two, to a gate that no one has ever registered, cataloged, or cleared for transit."*

You look at him now. Directly. The scrawny, underfed Gofer staring up at the broad-shouldered D-Rank tank with the expensive shield and the subscription-model mana-blade. And something in your eyes—the flatness of them, the absolute absence of bluff—makes **Goro Senta** take half a step back.

He doesn't realize he's done it. But **Mori** does. You see her notice.

> *"Goro. Shield forward. You're cutting us a path through Chamber Two. Reika takes everything that flanks left. Mori, you're on my hip—I need your scanner reading signatures in real time. Daisuke, you rotate buffs: Haste on Goro, Barrier on Reika, Sensory Boost cycling. Nobody stops. Nobody fights what they don't have to. We are not clearing this dungeon—we are LEAVING this dungeon."*

---

The thrumming above you shifts pitch. Lower. A half-tone drop that vibrates in your sternum like a second heartbeat. The fissure in the ceiling-entity's dome widens another centimeter. Two centimeters. Inside, something that might be light—or might be the *absence* of light—moves laterally, tracking.

It's watching you give orders.

It's *letting* you give orders.

That thought lodges in the back of your skull like a splinter. You file it. No time.

> *"MOVE!"*

---

### ⚔️ The Phalanx Breaks Forward

**Goro** moves.

Not because he trusts you. Not because he respects you. Because the alternative is standing still under a creature that makes his A-rated shield feel like wet cardboard, and **Kami Noteki** is the only person in this cavern who sounds like he knows what the hell is going on.

His shield expands—full deployment, hexagonal plates cascading outward into a barrier two meters wide. He drops his shoulder and *charges* into the tunnel mouth leading to Chamber Two like a human battering ram. The blue light of his barrier carves a wedge through the darkness.

The Crawlers on the tunnel walls **react**.

Not like insects. Like *soldiers*.

They peel off the rock in unison—a rippling wave of chitin and legs, dozens of bodies collapsing inward from ceiling and walls simultaneously. The sound is indescribable: a thousand ceramic tiles shattering in sequence, underscored by that wet, staccato clicking that fills every cubic centimeter of air.

---

**Goro** screams—not a battle cry, just *noise*, the raw output of a man whose body is running on cortisol and mana—and his shield catches the first wave. Three Crawlers slam into the hexagonal barrier at full velocity. The impact rings like a cathedral bell. His boots skid backward six inches on the stone floor. But the shield holds. The shield *holds*.

**Reika** is already in motion. She flows left like water finding a crack—mana-blade singing a high, thin note as it arcs through the first Crawler that breaks formation. The cut is clean. Bisection. The two halves tumble past her in different directions, legs still twitching. A second Crawler lunges from a ceiling crevice directly above her head. She doesn't look up. She *pivots*—pure muscle memory, the body of someone who's killed ten thousand of these things—and the blade takes its forelegs off at the joint. It drops, screaming that clicking scream, and she's past it before it hits the ground.

**Daisuke's** hands blur. **Haste** hits **Goro** like a shot of lightning—the tank's movements sharpen, the sluggishness of fear burned away by artificially accelerated synaptic response. **Barrier** wraps **Reika** in a skin-tight lattice of golden light. The buff rotation is textbook. 0.0 seconds of lag. Fear is a *wonderful* optimizer.

---

**Mori** is at your hip. Exactly where you told her to be. Her scanner paints the tunnel ahead in thermal overlay—blue-green signatures clustered, moving, rearranging.

> *"Thirty-one in Chamber Two,"* she says, running beside you, voice tight and controlled. *"The big ones—three of them—are holding position near the back wall. Not engaging. Not moving."*

Near the back wall.

Near where a second gate would be.

> *"They're guarding it,"* you say, and you don't need to explain what *it* is.

---

The tunnel opens into **Chamber Two** and the amber light of **Daisuke's** aura spills across a nightmare.

Crawlers. Everywhere. Clinging to every surface in that same rigid, geometric formation—concentric rings of chitin and compound eyes, arranged around three shapes pressed against the far wall that are emphatically, *violently* not Crawlers.

They're the same species as the ceiling-entity. Smaller—each one the size of a cargo loader instead of a shuttle—but unmistakable. Matte-black chitin armor. Blade-limbs that drink the light. Featureless domes split by horizontal fissures that pulse with that deep, bone-resonant thrumming.

And behind them, half-hidden by their massed bodies, the air *tears*.

A seam of light. Vertical. Ragged at the edges. Not the clean, stable purple of a registered Guild gate—this is white-hot and flickering, the color of a wound that hasn't decided whether to heal or hemorrhage. It looks *wrong*. It looks like someone cut a hole in the universe with a dull knife and forgot to stitch it shut.

The unregistered gate.

---

Your Status window flickers.

`[Class: None]`

Then, for one-tenth of a second—so fast you almost miss it, so fast you *should* miss it except your WIS is 18 and your brain catalogs anomalies like other people breathe—

`[sudo ac█ess requ██ted...]`

Gone. Back to `[Class: None]`.

Your heart rate spikes. You ignore it. Twenty-one hours and forty-seven minutes of **Panacea** remaining.

---

**Goro's** charge has stalled at the chamber entrance. He sees the three guardians. He sees the swarm. His shield flickers—courage faltering, mana wavering—and behind you, in the tunnel you just crossed, the sound of chitin on stone grows louder. The Crawlers from Chamber One are following. The ceiling-entity—the big one, the *original*—hasn't appeared yet.

But the thrumming hasn't stopped.

The pincer is closing. The anvil is ahead. The hammer is behind. And the only door out of this room is a white-hot scar in reality guarded by three things that outclass everyone in this party by a margin you can't calculate because *they aren't in any database.*

**Mori** looks at you. **Reika** looks at you. **Daisuke** looks at you.

**Goro** looks at you.

The Gofer. The pack-mule. The guy who carries the spare batteries.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The unregistered gate is forty meters away, guarded by three entities of unknown rank. The swarm is tightening from all sides. You have maybe ninety seconds before the chamber becomes a kill box with no gaps.

- **Order Goro to punch through** — Full charge, maximum shield output, straight at the guardians. Brute force. The party burns everything they have in one sixty-second sprint and prays the gate is traversable.
- **Deploy the pheromone vials** — They won't work on the guardians, but the *Crawlers* are still mutated Crawlers. If you can scatter the swarm, you create chaos—and chaos creates openings the guardians can't cover.
- **Use yourself as bait** — You're Unawakened. Your mana signature is effectively zero. The guardians are reacting to *threat level*. If the party holds position and you walk toward the gate alone, you might register as... nothing. Invisible. A ghost in the system.

*The thrumming behind you crescendos. The hammer is falling.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 30)

I swipe three adrenaline viles out from my pack, smack the caps off in one fell swoop, and jam all 3 needles into Goro, emptying the vials. 

It's enough to kill someone my size--I'm praying he's big enough to tolerate the dose. We're praying for hyped up and not heart attack. Then, I pull the vile of piss from my jacket pocket. The mutation may have caused some kind of hive behavior, and I have no doubt itll override their instincts--one look into that things eyes back in the other room and I dont even consider it: It has the final say. But Im not banking on them running away--Im banking on their reflexes and instncts. Before it commands them, they well recoil, and that can buy us the instance we need. Their flinch with Goro on enough adrenaline to fight a bear barehanded is our hail mary

#### 🎭 DM (Message 31)

### 💉 Three Needles and a Prayer

Your left hand moves before your brain grants permission. Muscle memory. The same hand that's organized forty-three kilograms of survival gear into sub-indexed compartments every morning for years—it knows where the adrenaline is. Upper-left panel. Third row. Velcro strap.

Three vials. Military-grade **Adrenacor-9**. Each one designed to bring a wounded hunter back from the edge of shock for exactly eleven minutes of heightened combat function. One per engagement. One per *person*. The dosage warning on the label says it in three languages and a pictogram.

You pop all three caps with your thumb in a single lateral swipe. The plastic guards scatter like teeth.

---

**Goro** sees you coming. His eyes go wide—not at the Crawlers, not at the guardians, but at the scrawny, hollow-cheeked Gofer lunging at him with three uncapped needles in his fist like a back-alley murderer.

> *"What the fu—"*

You jam them into the meat of his trapezius. All three. Simultaneous. Your thumb drives the plungers home with the precision of someone who's administered first aid in thirty-seven dungeon runs and never once had the luxury of hesitation.

The effect is not gradual.

---

**Goro Senta's** pupils dilate until the irises vanish. Every muscle in his body contracts at once—a full-body spasm that lifts him two centimeters off the cavern floor. His mana-shield doesn't flicker this time. It *detonates* outward—the hexagonal plates doubling in brightness, then doubling again, blue light flooding the chamber like a sun being born in a basement. His jaw locks. His teeth crack against each other. A sound comes out of him that isn't a scream and isn't a war cry. It's the sound of a human engine redlining past every safety governor it was built with.

His heart rate hits 190. 200. 210.

You watch his carotid artery pulse against the skin of his neck—visible, throbbing, a countdown you can't stop.

*Hold together. Hold together, you big stupid beautiful wall of meat.*

220.

It plateaus.

He holds.

---

### 🧪 The Flinch

Your right hand is already in your breast pocket. The **Tunnel Raptor pheromone vial**—your prized, hoarded, irreplaceable bottle of liquid nightmare. The thing you've carried into twelve runs and never once uncorked. You don't throw it at the guardians. You don't throw it at the swarm.

You throw it at the *floor* between them.

The glass shatters. A sound like a fingernail on a chalkboard, small and insignificant beneath the thrumming of the guardians and the clicking of sixty-plus Crawlers—

And then the smell hits.

---

It doesn't reach you in the way smells reach humans. You're not the target audience. But you *see* it reach them. Every single one. A wave propagating outward from the point of impact at the speed of chemical diffusion in warm, damp air—and the Crawlers' compound eyes all shift at once. Every geometric formation. Every perfectly held rank. Every soldier awaiting orders from the gods on the ceiling.

For one-point-three seconds, they are not soldiers.

They are *insects*.

The recoil is involuntary. Primordial. Written into chitin and nerve-clusters millions of years before whatever came through that unregistered gate taught them to stand in rows. Legs retract. Bodies curl. The concentric rings of the swarm *buckle*—not breaking, not fleeing, just flinching—a sharp, universal contraction away from the epicenter of the scent, like a hand jerking back from a hot stove.

The guardians don't flinch. Their fissures pulse. The thrumming spikes—a command frequency, a recall signal, the hive-mind reasserting control—

But the command takes time to propagate. Neural pathways. Signal latency. Even gods have ping.

**One-point-three seconds.**

---

### 🔥 The Charge

> *"GORO! FORWARD! NOW! DON'T STOP FOR ANYTHING!"*

He doesn't need to be told. Three doses of **Adrenacor-9** have reduced **Goro Senta** to something elemental—a ballistic object wrapped in blue light with a heart rate that could power a generator. He launches forward like a round leaving a chamber. His boots crack the stone floor. His shield—blazing, incandescent, no longer the flickering thing it was ten seconds ago but a battering ram of compressed mana—leads the charge directly into the gap the flinch created.

The first Crawler recovers too slow. **Goro** hits it shield-first at full sprint. It doesn't get pushed. It gets *erased*—chitin plates shattering into fragments that spray outward in a cone of biological shrapnel. The second Crawler drops from the wall to intercept. **Goro** doesn't slow down. Doesn't deviate. The shield catches it mid-air and pins it against the cavern floor as he runs *over* it. The wet crunch beneath his boots is the sound of something that used to be alive becoming geography.

---

**Reika** is on his left. Moving in the slipstream of his charge like a blade following a fist. A Crawler lunges from a ceiling hollow—recovering, the hive-mind's command reaching its nerve clusters a half-second too late to keep it docile. Her mana-edge takes its head. She doesn't look at it. Doesn't need to. **Daisuke's** **Barrier** flashes gold around her shoulders as a second set of mandibles glances off the lattice and spins away.

**Mori** is on your right. Scanner up. Reading the chaos in thermal overlay.

> *"Twenty meters!"* she calls. *"Guardians are turning! They're—"*

The three guardians peel off the back wall.

---

They move like nothing you've ever seen in a bestiary or a briefing or a nightmare. Liquid. The matte-black chitin doesn't reflect **Goro's** blazing shield-light—it *drinks* it. They unfold from their positions with the terrible grace of hydraulic machinery, blade-limbs extending, fissures flaring wide, and the thrumming that comes out of them is no longer a background hum. It's a sound you feel in your *spine*. A frequency that says *stop*. A frequency that says *kneel*.

**Goro** doesn't stop. **Goro** *can't* stop. His brain is swimming in enough synthetic adrenaline to make a freight shuttle feel claustrophobic. He sees the first guardian directly in his path and does the only thing his chemically simplified nervous system can process:

He lowers his shoulder and hits it.

---

The impact sounds like a starship hull breach.

**Goro's** shield meets the guardian's crossed blade-limbs. Blue hexagons against void-black chitin. The cavern shakes. Stalactites crack overhead. The bioluminescent fungal colonies nearest the collision point *die*—snuffed out instantly by the shockwave, plunging that section of ceiling into absolute dark.

He doesn't break through. Not entirely. But the guardian *slides*—four clawed feet gouging trenches in the stone as **Goro's** adrenaline-fueled mass forces it backward. One meter. Two. Just enough. Just barely enough to open a gap between it and the cavern wall.

A gap the size of a person.

---

> *"GO!"* **Mori** shoves you toward the gap.

You don't think. You run. Forty-three kilograms of pack slamming against your spine. CON 7 screaming in every joint, every tendon, every fiber of muscle that hasn't had a proper meal in weeks. The guardian's blade-limb sweeps overhead—you feel the displaced air part your hair, feel the cold of that light-that-subtracts pass across the back of your neck like a razor that missed by a margin measured in millimeters.

**Reika** slides through behind you. Then **Daisuke**. Then **Mori**.

**Goro** holds the line for two more seconds—shield cracking now, fracture lines spreading through the hexagonal plates like ice on a pond—before disengaging with a roar and barreling backward through the gap his own charge created.

---

### 🕳️ The Other Side

The unregistered gate is *right there*.

Five meters. A vertical seam of white-hot, ragged light. Up close it's worse than it looked from across the chamber. The edges writhe. The light isn't steady—it *breathes*, expanding and contracting like a wound with a pulse. The air around it tastes like ozone and copper and something older. Something that doesn't have a name in any language spoken in the solar system.

Behind you, the swarm reconsolidates. The flinch is over. The hive-mind has reasserted control. The Crawlers flow back into formation—not pursuing, not yet, but *sealing* the chamber behind you like a living wall. The three guardians reposition. The thrumming harmonizes into a single, resonant chord that makes your vision swim.

And from the tunnel connecting Chambers One and Two, a shadow moves. Massive. The matte-black silhouette of the original ceiling-entity—the shuttle-sized god of this dungeon—folding itself through the passage with a silence that something that large should not possess.

**Goro's** shield gutters. Flickers. One of the hexagonal plates disintegrates into blue motes.

His hands are shaking. Not from fear now. From the adrenaline. His body is beginning to understand what you did to it, and the bill is coming due.

> *"Gofer..."* His voice is vibrating. Literally. His vocal cords can't hold steady. *"...if this kills me... I'm haunting you... forever..."*

---

The gate breathes. In. Out. In.

Beyond it: the unknown. An unregistered Colony gate. Could be a dead rock. Could be a jungle moon full of things that make the guardians look like house pets. Could be the hard vacuum of space on the other side and you all die in four seconds.

Behind you: certain death, arriving in approximately fifteen seconds.

**Mori** looks at the gate. Looks at you. Her scanner is useless—it can't read through an unregistered gate. Nobody's can.

> *"Your call, Gofer."*

She used your title. Not your name. But she said it differently this time. Like it meant something.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The gate is five meters away. The swarm is sealing the chamber behind you. Fifteen seconds before the ceiling-entity arrives. Goro's shield is failing. The other side is a complete unknown.

- **Step through first** — You're Unawakened. Zero mana signature. If there's something hostile on the other side, you're the least likely to trigger it. You go first, and you go alone.
- **Send everyone through at once** — No time for recon. Everyone jumps. Whatever's on the other side, you face it together.
- **Push Goro through first** — His shield, even cracked, is the best defense you have. If something's waiting, he tanks it. He's already running on borrowed time anyway.

*The thrumming crescendos. The shadow fills the tunnel mouth behind you.*

*Fourteen seconds.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 32)

Step through first, but before I do, I warn them "dont hesitat.." and Im gone

#### 🎭 DM (Message 33)

### 🕳️ The Threshold

> *"Don't hesitat—"*

The word dies in the white.

---

Not cold this time. Not the clean, clinical 3.7-second transition of a registered gate. This is *hot*. A searing, full-body immersion—like being fed through a wound in the universe inch by inch. The white-hot light doesn't peel away from your skin. It pushes *through* it. You feel your teeth. Not pain exactly—*awareness*. Every molecule in your body suddenly conscious of every other molecule, vibrating at a frequency that makes your vision go to static and your thoughts scatter like roaches in a lit room.

The holo-emitter in your pocket burns against your chest. **Belial's** face flickers behind your eyelids—not the message, just the afterimage of it, seared into your retinas by repetition and devotion and the desperate mathematics of love.

Your Status window does something it has never done before.

It *screams*.

---

`[Class: None]`
`[Class: None]`
`[Class: N̴̢o̵̱n̸̳e̷̤]`

Then nothing.

`[Class: None]`

The transit ends.

---

### 🌌 The Other Side

You hit ground. Real ground—not stone, not metal grating, not the composite flooring of a Phobos station corridor. *Dirt.* Your hands sink into it. Cool. Damp. Smelling of something green and ancient and impossible, because nothing in the solar system smells like this. Nothing in the *Belt* has smelled like living soil since before the gates opened.

You're on your hands and knees. Forty-three kilograms of pack pressing you into the earth like a penitent at prayer. Your lungs heave. CON 7 reminds you that it exists, that it has always existed, that you are a fragile arrangement of meat and math held together by spite and a payment plan.

You look up.

---

Sky.

Not a cavern ceiling. Not the inside of a station hull. Not the radiation-filtered dome of a Mars settlement.

*Sky.*

Violet. Deep, bruised violet fading to black at the zenith, where stars hang in configurations you have never seen in any astronomical chart published by any institution in the solar system. Two moons—one rust-red, one the pale blue of a drowned man's lips—sit low on a horizon defined by a treeline of *things* that might be trees the way a shark might be a fish. Tall. Black. Branching in fractal patterns that hurt to follow with your eyes, their canopies emitting a faint bioluminescence that paints the forest floor in shifting patterns of amber and violet.

The air is breathable. Warm. Humid. It tastes like copper and petrichor and ozone—the aftertaste of the gate still clinging to your sinuses.

You are not in the solar system.

You are not anywhere the Adventurer's Guild has jurisdiction.

You are not anywhere *anyone* has jurisdiction.

---

Behind you, the gate hangs in the air like a scar that forgot to heal—vertical, ragged, white-hot, pulsing with that same wounded rhythm. It hovers two meters off the ground between two of the black not-trees, their fractal branches curling away from it like fingers recoiling from flame.

Then the scar *splits wider*—

And **Mori** comes through.

---

She hits the ground rolling. Scanner up before her knees touch dirt. Training. Reflex. The consummate professional, even mid-freefall through an unregistered wormhole into deep space. Her eyes sweep the treeline, the sky, the twin moons—and for one unguarded second, her composure cracks. You see it. The micro-expression of someone whose entire model of reality just suffered a structural failure.

She finds you. On your hands and knees. Pack askew. Dirt on your face. Alive.

> *"...You absolute lunatic."*

It's the warmest thing she's ever said to you.

---

**Reika** is next. She stumbles through the gate and immediately vomits—the transit hitting her harder, her mana-channels reacting to the unregistered crossing like a immune system rejecting a foreign body. **Daisuke** follows, pale and shaking, his buff auras flickering erratically as his System interface tries to recalibrate to a location that doesn't exist in its database.

Then **Goro**.

He doesn't walk through the gate. He *falls* through it. Two hundred and twenty pounds of chemically overclocked muscle and cracked mana-shield, hitting the alien soil like a dropped refrigerator. The blue hexagons of his shield wink out. His eyes are open but unfocused—pupils still blown, heart still jackhammering, the triple dose of **Adrenacor-9** winding down from miracle to invoice. His breathing is ragged. Arrhythmic. The sound of an engine that ran too hot for too long.

But he's breathing.

They're all breathing.

---

The gate behind you pulses once. Twice. The white-hot edges flicker—and for a terrible, stomach-dropping instant, it *narrows*. The scar contracting. Healing. Closing.

It stabilizes. Barely. The ragged seam holds its shape, but the light is dimmer now. Weaker. The pulse slower, like a heartbeat losing conviction.

Your way back to the solar system—to Mars, to Phobos Station, to the 21 hours and 33 minutes of **Panacea** keeping **Belial Noteki** alive—is a wound in space that is slowly, visibly, deciding whether or not to close.

---

**Mori** sees it too. Her scanner is pointed at the gate, and whatever she's reading makes her jaw tighten.

> *"It's degrading. I can't tell you how fast—my equipment isn't calibrated for... whatever this is. But it's not stable. Hours. Maybe less."*

The alien forest hums around you. A low, ambient drone—not insects, not wind, something *structural*, as if the air itself has a resonant frequency. The bioluminescent canopy shifts. Amber to violet. Violet to amber. The twin moons hang like mismatched eyes watching you from the edge of the world.

**Goro** groans from the dirt. **Reika** wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, mana-blade reigniting with a shaky flicker. **Daisuke** is staring at his Status window with an expression you've never seen on a support-class before: total, abject confusion.

> *"My buffs aren't reading any of you,"* he says. Quietly. Like admitting it might make it real. *"The party interface is... it's showing your names, but everything else is just... question marks."*

---

Five people. One dying gate. An uncharted world under an alien sky. No map. No Guild support. No comms signal—you check, because of course you check—nothing but static on every frequency.

And in your pocket, the holo-emitter is warm against your chest. Warmer than it should be. Warmer than it's ever been.

You don't check it. Not yet. Not with everyone watching.

But you feel it. Like a second heartbeat.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

You're on an unregistered Colony world with a dying gate, four shaken D-Rankers, and no way to call for help. The forest hums. The moons stare. Somewhere in the canopy, the bioluminescence shifts in a pattern that might be random and might not be.

- **Triage the team** — Goro's crashing from the adrenaline. Daisuke's System is glitching. Stabilize your people before anything else.
- **Study the gate** — If it's closing, you need to understand *how fast* and whether anything in your kit or your knowledge can slow the degradation. Every second of data counts.
- **Scout the immediate area** — You're standing in the open beneath an alien treeline on a world you know nothing about. Before you do anything else, you need to know if something already knows you're here.

*The forest hums. Twenty-one hours. Thirty-three minutes.*

*The math is already running.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 34)

Triage the team. There's no way I make it back to my wife and tomorrow's Panacea payment without them. This is a D-rank team, that they've held up this long is a miracle. Their coordination, team work, instincts were all two ranks higher than that just now--or maybe my taking charge elevated them as a team? The thought falls away to the immediate concern. Goro's heart is in danger.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 35)

### 💊 Field Triage Under Foreign Stars

The thought about their coordination—about whether *you* somehow made four strangers fight like a unit—lasts exactly one-point-two seconds before **Goro** seizes.

His back arches off the alien soil. Every muscle firing at once, tendons standing out like bridge cables under the skin of his neck. His jaw locks open. No sound comes out. The worst seizures are the silent ones—you know this because you read the **Adrenacor-9** manufacturer's toxicology report eighteen months ago, on a Tuesday, because the shipment had arrived at the guild dispensary and you wanted to know what you were carrying.

You're already moving.

---

Pack off. Not thrown—*placed*. Right side up, compartments accessible. Your hands find the medical sub-kit without looking. Upper-left panel, second row, below the adrenaline you just emptied into this man's bloodstream like a prayer written in poison.

**Cardizem ampoule.** Calcium channel blocker. Slows the heart by convincing the electrical system to stop screaming. You crack the seal with your thumbnail—clean, practiced, the motion of someone who's rehearsed worst-case scenarios the way other people rehearse excuses.

> *"Reika. Hold his head. Don't let him bite through his tongue."*

Your voice is flat. Quiet. The exhaustion is still there—CON 7 doesn't take breaks—but something else is driving the machine now. Something that runs on math and muscle memory and the cold, clarifying knowledge that if this man's heart fibrillates, you die on an alien world twenty-one hours before your wife runs out of medicine.

**Reika** moves. She doesn't question it. Her hands—the same hands that bisected six Chitin Crawlers without blinking—cradle **Goro's** skull against the damp earth with a gentleness that surprises you. Surprises *her*, from the look on her face.

---

You find the vein. Antecubital fossa, left arm. His veins are easy—the man is a walking anatomy chart, every vessel inflated by the adrenaline surge, blue-green highways under flushed skin. The needle slides in. You depress the plunger with your thumb. Slow. Controlled. Not all at once—you titrate, watching his carotid pulse, counting the rhythm against the seconds in your head.

220\. 218\. 215.

The soil beneath your knees smells like something alive. The twin moons cast overlapping shadows—one warm, one cold—and for a moment the light on **Goro's** face shifts between rust and blue like a man caught between two futures.

210\. 205.

His jaw unlocks. A ragged, gasping breath—the sound of a drowning man finding the surface. His eyes are still blown, but the seizure releases its grip one muscle group at a time: hands first, then shoulders, then the rigid arch of his spine settling back into the dirt.

198\. 190.

---

> *"Daisuke. What's his System readout? Anything?"*

**Daisuke** is still staring at his own Status window, at the question marks where his party's vitals should be. His hands are shaking. Support-class hunters live inside their interfaces—it's their instrument panel, their cockpit, their entire relationship with the world filtered through buff timers and health percentages. Take that away and they're pianists with broken fingers.

> *"I... it's not... I can't read—"*

> *"Then read HIM."*

You don't snap. You don't have the energy to snap. But the words land with enough weight to pull **Daisuke's** eyes off his flickering interface and onto the man on the ground.

> *"Breathing. Pulse. Pupil response. You learned field assessment before you ever got a System window. Use it."*

---

Something shifts behind **Daisuke's** eyes. A gear catching. He drops to his knees beside **Goro**, and his hands—still trembling—find the tank's wrist. Two fingers on the radial artery. Lips moving, counting silently. The amber glow of his buff aura gutters out entirely as he stops trying to force his System to work and starts doing the thing underneath the System. The human thing.

> *"Pulse is... fast. But steadier. Rhythm's evening out."*

**175.** You can see it in the carotid. You don't need the number confirmed, but **Daisuke** needed to be the one to say it. Needed to remember he's more than a UI.

You tape the IV line to **Goro's** arm with surgical adhesive from the kit. Apply a cooling patch to his neck—the big vessels run close to the surface there, and his core temperature is still dangerously elevated. Then you sit back on your heels and let out a breath that tastes like copper and alien petrichor.

---

**Goro's** eyes focus. Slowly. Like a camera adjusting aperture. He stares up at the violet sky, at the stars he doesn't recognize, at the twin moons hanging like mismatched dice thrown by a careless god.

> *"...still alive?"* His voice is gravel dragged through a pipe.

> *"Your heart rate peaked at two-twenty. Ventricular tachycardia threshold for a man your size is around two-thirty. You had ten beats per minute of margin."*

A pause. The forest hums.

> *"You're welcome."*

**Goro** lets out something between a laugh and a cough. It's wet. It's ugly. But it's the sound of a living man, and right now that's the only currency that matters.

---

### 👁️ The Way They Look At You

You move through the rest of the triage like a machine running its program.

**Reika:** Mana-channel inflammation from the unregistered gate transit. You hand her an anti-inflammatory patch and a hydration sachet. She takes them without comment, but her eyes follow your hands—the way they move through the pack without searching, without hesitating. The way every item is exactly where your fingers expect it to be.

**Daisuke:** System interface destabilized, but physiologically sound. You tell him to stop trying to force-reconnect his buffs and let the System recalibrate on its own. He nods, then asks—quietly, like it costs him something—

> *"How do you know it'll recalibrate?"*

> *"Because Systems are software. Software doesn't break from novel input—it hangs, then reboots. Give it time."*

He stares at you. The question-mark expression on his face isn't confusion anymore. It's something else. Something you've seen on researchers' faces at the Guild archives when they find a paper that contradicts everything they thought they knew.

---

**Mori** doesn't need triage. She's bruised, scratched, running hot on adrenaline—the organic kind—but functional. Instead, she stands at the perimeter, scanner sweeping the treeline in slow arcs. Professional. Vigilant.

But between sweeps, she looks at you.

They all do.

Not the way they looked at you in the Phobos dungeon—past you, through you, the way you look at furniture. This is different. **Goro** is staring at the ceiling of alien sky, but his eyes keep drifting to the medical tape on his arm. To the cooling patch on his neck. To the things that kept his heart from stopping, pulled from the pack of the man he called *Gofer*.

**Reika** is turning the anti-inflammatory patch over in her fingers. Reading the label. It's not standard Guild issue. It's aftermarket—a compound you sourced from a Belt pharmacy six months ago because the Guild-supplied version has a 3% interaction risk with mana-channel suppressants, and you'd calculated that *eventually* a hunter in your party would need one after a rough transit.

Six months ago. For a scenario that hadn't happened yet.

She looks at the patch. She looks at you—crouched in the dirt, hollow-cheeked, Class: None, the thinnest and weakest person on this entire planet by every metric the System tracks.

> *"...Who* ***are*** *you?"*

It's not a question about your name.

---

You don't answer. You're already repacking the kit. Compartments re-indexed for the new scenario: alien environment, unknown hostiles, no resupply, degrading gate. The medical supplies shift from sub-category to primary. The monster-repellent vials move to secondary. Three adrenaline vials empty; you note the absence and adjust.

The holo-emitter in your pocket pulses warm against your chest. Warmer than body heat. Warmer than this planet's ambient air.

You don't check it.

Not yet.

---

Somewhere in the black fractal canopy above you, the bioluminescence shifts. Not randomly—you catch it in your peripheral vision. A ripple. A pattern. Amber-violet-amber, moving laterally through the branches, *tracking* your position the way the fungal colonies in the Phobos cavern tracked the ceiling-entity's movement.

Something in this forest knows you're here.

It hasn't introduced itself yet.

The gate behind you exhales. The white-hot edges flicker, contract, stabilize. Flicker again. The pulse is slower than it was two minutes ago. **Mori** sees it too—you catch the tightening of her jaw in the moonlight.

Twenty-one hours. Twenty-six minutes.

The math is always running.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The team is stabilized. **Goro** is conscious but weakened—his shield needs time to regenerate, and his body is paying the triple-adrenaline tax. **Daisuke's** System is rebooting. **Reika** and **Mori** are combat-ready but shaken. The dying gate is your only known exit. The forest is watching.

- **Study the gate degradation** — You need hard numbers. How fast is it closing? Can anything in your knowledge base slow or stabilize an unregistered gate? Every minute of data is a minute of options.
- **Scout the treeline** — Something is tracking you through the canopy. Better to identify it on your terms than wait for it to decide you've rested long enough.
- **Check the holo-emitter** — It's never been this warm. Something changed during the transit. You need to know what—even if it's nothing. Even if it's everything.

*The forest hums. The gate breathes. **Reika's** question hangs in the air, unanswered.*

*Who are you?*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 36)

I ignore Reika's question. I ignore the way the forest hums like a tuning fork pressed against my skull. I ignore the fact that my hands are shaking—not from fear, but from the terrifying clarity that comes when you realize the only thing standing between you and the end of your world is a physics problem you haven't solved yet.

"Philosophy later," I say, my voice scraping against the silence. "Physics now."

I move to the gate.

The closer I get, the more the air tastes like ozone and copper. The white-hot edge of the rift isn't just light; it's a frequency. A vibration so high it registers as heat. I drop my pack, kneeling in the dirt two meters from the threshold. My eyes scan the perimeter of the tear—not looking for magic, but for the mechanics of the collapse.

It’s oscillating.
Expand. Contract. Expand. Contract.
But the contractions are lasting longer. Milliseconds longer.

I pull out my data-pad. Cracked screen. Battery at 14%. I hold it up to the rift, running a standard spectrum analysis—the kind used to check shield harmonics on Phobos. The screen fuzzes, glitches, then spits out a waveform that looks like a EKG of a heart attack.

"It's not just closing," I mutter, the math falling into place in my head like tumblers in a lock. "It's losing phase coherence. The anchor on this side is drifting."

That's when the heat in my chest becomes unbearable.

The holo-emitter.

I reach into my pocket and pull it out. It’s vibrating so hard it blurs in my grip. The metal casing is hot enough to be uncomfortable, pulsing in perfect sync with the gate’s contraction.

Thrum. Pulse. Thrum. Pulse.

I stare at it. A cheap, mass-produced civilian holo-emitter. It shouldn't be reacting to a spatial rift. It shouldn't be reacting to anything except the "Play" button.

Unless...

"It's a resonance loop," I whisper.

Mori is beside me instantly, scanner still trained on the treeline but eyes on the device in my hand.
"What is?"

"The gate. It's unstable because it's untethered. It needs a constant frequency to maintain the aperture. My emitter... it uses a localized hard-light projection field. It's primitive, but it operates on a similar frequency band to the gate's edge."

I look at the gate. Then at the emitter.
When I hold the emitter closer, the gate's ragged edge smooths out. The white light steadies. The contraction slows.
When I pull it back, the rift shudders and narrows by an inch.

The math is brutal.
The emitter acts as a harmonic stabilizer. A temporary anchor. But to work, it needs to be inside the field. It needs to be part of the circuit.
And if I use it to prop the door open... I might burn it out.
The recording. The face. The voice. The only piece of her I have left, will be the only way I get back to her to keep her alive. 

Twenty-one hours, twenty-five minutes.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 37)

### 🔬 Phase Coherence

The data-pad's waveform is garbage to anyone else. To you it's a confession.

You've seen gate harmonics on a hundred spectrum reads—the clean, regulated sine waves of Guild-maintained apertures, each one a tuned instrument in an orchestra of spatial mechanics. What's on your cracked screen isn't music. It's a flatline trying to remember how to be a heartbeat. The fundamental frequency is drifting by 0.003 hertz per second—imperceptible to instruments that aren't looking for it, catastrophic on a timeline measured in hours.

You run the decay curve in your head. You don't need the data-pad for this part. The math is just *there*, the way breathing is there, the way **Belial's** face is there when you close your eyes.

Ninety-seven minutes. Give or take twelve.

That's how long before the phase coherence drops below the threshold required to maintain a traversable aperture. After that, the gate becomes a scar—visible, maybe, but solid. A window you can look through but never open.

---

Behind you, the party watches a man they called *Gofer* kneel in alien dirt with a cracked data-pad and read the death certificate of their only way home.

**Mori** is closest. Her scanner is aimed at the treeline but her body is angled toward you—toward the device in your hand, toward the way the gate's ragged edge responds to it like a stray dog hearing a familiar whistle. Her eyes track the movement as you push the emitter closer, pull it back. Closer. Back. The rift smoothing, shuddering, smoothing. A call-and-response between a cheap civilian device and a hole in the fabric of spacetime.

> *"That's... that shouldn't work,"* she says. Quiet. The voice of someone watching a magic trick and looking for the wire.

> *"It's not magic. It's frequency matching."*

Your voice is flat. Clinical. The voice you use when the math is too ugly to dress up.

> *"Hard-light projection fields operate on the 7.8 to 8.4 terahertz band. Guild gates are maintained at a regulated 8.1. This thing—"*

You hold the emitter up. The casing is almost too hot to grip. **Belial's** face flickers in and out of existence above it—half-formed, ghosting, her mouth caught mid-syllable in a word you've memorized but can't hear over the hum of the dying gate.

> *"—was manufactured to spec. Civilian tolerances. But the base frequency is close enough to create a sympathetic resonance with the gate's collapsing waveform. It can't *power* the gate. But it can slow the bleed. Act as a temporary harmonic anchor while the aperture stabilizes around it."*

---

### 🫀 The Recording

You hold it in your palm. Forty-two grams. Injection-molded polymer casing, brushed aluminum faceplate, a projection lens the size of a shirt button. Retail price: 1,200 credits. You bought it used for 400 at a Belt pawnshop because the volume toggle was sticky and the previous owner wanted the newer model.

It contains one file. Forty-one seconds long.

**Belial**, sitting on the edge of a hospital bed that cost more per night than you made in a week. Hair still long then. Still dark. The gown hanging off one shoulder because she never could stand how they fit. The camera—your camera, held in your shaking hand—catching the light through the ward window as she looked up and said the thing she said.

You know every frame. Every pixel. The exact moment her eyes crinkle. The way her left hand comes up to push hair behind her ear—a gesture so automatic she did it even after the hair was gone. The sound of her voice, slightly hoarse from the medication, wrapping around those two words like they were the simplest thing in the world.

*Wish me luck.*

Forty-one seconds. The last thing she recorded before the **Panacea** regime started and the visits became about dosages and timelines and the quiet, clinical arithmetic of keeping someone you love alive one payment at a time.

---

You look at the gate. White-hot. Breathing. Dying.

You look at the emitter. **Belial's** face, half-rendered in stuttering hard-light, smiling at a camera held by a man who still believed the math would work out.

The resonance is already happening. The emitter *wants* to sync—you can feel it in the vibration, in the way the heat pulses in time with the gate's contractions. All you have to do is place it inside the field. Let it become part of the circuit. The gate stabilizes. The aperture holds. Everyone goes home.

And the emitter burns out. The hard-light projector overloads. The file—the forty-one seconds, the hair behind the ear, the *wish me luck*—

Gone.

Or you keep it. And in ninety-seven minutes, the gate closes, and **Belial Noteki** dies in a hospital bed on Mars because her husband is standing on a planet that doesn't have a name, holding a recording of her face instead of buying her another day.

---

**Daisuke** has stopped staring at his glitching Status window. He's staring at the hologram. At the woman's face flickering above the device in your hand. He doesn't know who she is. He doesn't need to. The look on your face is a language everyone speaks.

**Reika** steps forward. One step. Stops. Her mouth opens—closes. The mana-blade at her side gutters out. She didn't dismiss it. It just... stopped, as if the weapon itself understood that whatever is happening in front of her isn't a thing that swords can help with.

**Goro**, still flat on his back, head turned, watches you through eyes that are finally, fully clear. The adrenaline fog is gone. What's left is a man seeing another man hold something precious over a fire.

> *"...Gofer."*

His voice is quiet. No swagger. No bluster. The voice under the voice—the one he probably hasn't used since he was small enough for it to be honest.

> *"What's on that thing?"*

---

**Mori** answers for you. Not with words. She puts her hand on **Goro's** shoulder—a gesture so slight he might not even feel it through the armor—and shakes her head once.

*Don't.*

The forest hums. The twin moons stare. Somewhere in the fractal canopy, the bioluminescence ripples—amber-violet-amber—tracking, watching, waiting with the patience of something that has never known a deadline.

Your Status window flickers at the edge of your vision.

`[Class: None]`

Then:

`[s̸u̶d̷o̵ ̷a̷c̸c̵e̶s̷s̶ ̸r̵e̸q̸u̶e̸s̵t̶e̷d̵.̴.̸.̵]`
`[a̶n̵c̶h̷o̸r̵ ̷d̷e̶t̷e̵c̷t̷e̸d̵]`
`[c̶o̸m̸p̴a̶t̸i̸b̵l̷e̴ ̵v̸e̵s̸s̷e̵l̷ ̷i̶d̴e̷n̶t̴i̵f̸i̸e̵d̶]`

Gone. Back to nothing. Fast enough that you almost—*almost*—convince yourself you imagined it.

The emitter burns in your palm. Forty-two grams. Forty-one seconds. Twenty-one hours and twenty-four minutes.

The math has never been this simple. The math has never been this cruel.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The gate is dying. The emitter can save it. The cost is the last recording of your wife's voice. Ninety-seven minutes before the decision makes itself.

- **Place the emitter in the gate field** — Stabilize the aperture. Burn the file. Keep the path home open. Get back to **Belial** with nothing left of her but memory—and memory fades.

- **Keep the emitter. Find another way.** — Ninety-seven minutes. An alien world. Four D-Rankers with failing Systems. There might be another anchor. There might be another solution. There might be nothing. But you'll have her voice in your pocket while you look.

- **Ask Daisuke** — His System is rebooting. His buffs operate on hard-light adjacent frequencies. If his interface comes back online in time, his support-class toolkit *might* serve as an alternative anchor. It's a theory. Untested. And it depends on a System that's currently showing nothing but question marks.

*The gate breathes. In. Out. In.*

*The hologram flickers. **Belial** pushes hair behind her ear.*

*Eighty-nine minutes now.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 38)

I muster my resolve. There was only ever one option. I place the emitter in the gate field with all the fanfare of a switchboard operator connecting a circuit. I've got to get my party out of here. I'm the only one that can do this. We need to prepare for what's on the other side of the gate--but that's not a concern if the gate collapses first. 

This will stabilize the gate long enough for us to fully rest, recover, and strategize our way back to Phobos. Back to my wife, whose life depends on my return. 

Even as I turn my attention to the scuttling canopy, I'm counting minutes. Doing math.

The new destabilization time: 36 hours, 9 minutes. I need to be back in Twenty-one hours, twenty-three minutes. Time to spare...

The thought it interrupted. Whatever's been stalking us is no longer searching. We've been found. 

"It's here." I announce to the party.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 39)

### 🔧 Wish Me Luck

You don't hesitate. That's the part they'll never understand—any of them—when they replay this moment later in the quiet of their own heads. There was no hesitation. No trembling lip. No cinematic pause where the orchestra swells and the hero stares into the middle distance weighing the cost of sacrifice.

You press "Play" one last time.

---

**Belial's** face blooms above the lens. Full resolution. Every pixel. The hospital gown slipping off one shoulder. The light through the ward window catching the dust motes—tiny galaxies orbiting her collarbone. Her left hand rises, pushes hair behind her ear. Hair that's been gone for eleven months now.

Her mouth moves.

*Wish me luck.*

The sound doesn't carry. You turned the volume off. This one's yours—the shape of the words on her lips, the crinkle at the corner of her eye, the way her chin dips at the end like she's sharing a secret with the only person in the universe who matters.

Forty-one seconds.

You watch all of them.

---

Then you kneel in alien dirt, and you slot the emitter into the gate field the way a tired electrician connects a junction box at the end of a twelve-hour shift. Push. Click. Done.

No fanfare. No prayer. The hands of a man who has carried other people's survival gear for two years and never once dropped a vial.

---

The resonance catches immediately.

The emitter's hard-light frequency locks onto the gate's collapsing waveform like a key finding a lock it was cut for. The white-hot edges of the rift *snap* taut—ragged wound becoming clean incision, the breathing rhythm steadying from arrhythmic gasp to slow, even pulse. The ozone taste in the air thins. The copper aftertaste fades. The gate doesn't heal—it's still a scar, still wrong, still a dull knife's work—but the hemorrhaging stops.

The emitter casing glows cherry-red. Then white. The projection lens cracks—a hairline fracture running from edge to edge—and **Belial's** face flickers one last time above it. Half a frame. Less. The ghost of a ghost.

Gone.

The lens goes dark. The file is ash. Forty-one seconds of her voice, burned to nothing on the altar of a frequency match that any first-year physics student could have calculated.

Your data-pad reads the new waveform. Stable. Anchored. Decay curve recalculated.

**Thirty-six hours. Nine minutes.**

You need twenty-one hours and twenty-three minutes.

Time to spare.

---

### 👁️ What They See

**Mori** watches you stand up, brush the dirt off your knees, and re-pocket the data-pad. She watched the hologram die. She saw the woman's face. She saw yours—or rather, she saw the *absence* of expression on yours, the flat nothing of a man who has already done the grief math and filed it under acceptable losses.

She opens her mouth. Closes it. Opens it again.

Says nothing.

**Daisuke** is staring at the stabilized gate, at the cherry-red emitter lodged in its field like a heart transplant keeping a dead thing alive. His System interface flickers—the question marks stuttering, rearranging, almost resolving into data before scrambling again. But something in his face has changed. The confusion is gone. In its place: the expression of a man watching someone else do the thing he couldn't.

**Reika** hasn't moved. She's still holding the anti-inflammatory patch you gave her. Her mana-blade is still dark at her hip. She's looking at you the way you'd look at a locked room you just realized has been open the entire time.

**Goro** is sitting up now. Cooling patch still on his neck. IV line taped to his arm. His color is coming back—pink replacing the ashen gray of a man whose heart nearly vibrated itself apart. He watches you check your data-pad, re-index your pack, calculate the new timeline—all in the same motion, all without breaking stride, all with the mechanical efficiency of someone who treats emotion like a luxury item he cancelled the subscription on.

> *"...You had a person on that thing."*

Not a question. His voice is quiet. The real one—the one under the swagger.

> *"Didn't you."*

---

You don't answer. You're already turning away from the gate. Already facing the treeline. Already counting.

The bioluminescence in the fractal canopy has stopped shifting.

That's what makes your spine straighten. Not movement—the *cessation* of movement. For the last six minutes, the amber-violet pattern has been propagating laterally through the branches, tracking your position with the lazy curiosity of something that had all the time in the world. Ripple. Shift. Ripple. The rhythm of a predator circling a watering hole, cataloguing, assessing, deciding.

The rhythm has stopped.

Everything has stopped.

The forest's ambient hum—that low, structural drone you've been filing as background noise since you landed—drops in pitch. Half a tone. Then another. Like a machine winding down. Like a breath being held.

---

> *"It's here."*

Your voice is the flattest thing on this planet. Two words. No inflection. The same tone you'd use to announce rain.

**Mori's** scanner snaps to the treeline. **Reika's** mana-blade reignites—sputtering, unsteady, but *lit*. **Daisuke's** hands rise, fingers splayed, reaching for buff channels that may or may not respond. **Goro** tries to stand, makes it to one knee, shield arm raised—no hexagons form. The mana's still recharging. He's holding up an empty hand and pretending it's enough.

---

The first sign isn't visual.

It's gravitational.

The dirt beneath your boots *shifts*—not like an earthquake, nothing so dramatic. More like the ground sighing. A subtle redistribution of weight, as if something incomprehensibly massive just leaned closer and the planet adjusted its posture to compensate. The twin moons flicker. Not in the sky—their light on the ground, the overlapping rust-and-blue shadows, *bends*. Curves inward toward a point thirty meters into the treeline, where the fractal branches have gone perfectly, absolutely still.

Then the canopy opens.

Not parts. Not breaks. *Opens*—the black, fractal branches folding away from a central point with the geometric precision of an iris dilating, and the bioluminescence that has been painting the forest floor in amber and violet *concentrates*. Funnels inward. A hundred scattered points of light becoming ten, becoming three, becoming one—a single, blazing column of amber-white radiance pouring down through the gap in the canopy like a spotlight on an empty stage.

---

Something steps into the light.

It doesn't walk. It *arrives*—one frame it isn't there, the next frame it is, as if the intervening distance was a formality it chose not to observe. Tall. Taller than **Goro** by a full meter. A silhouette that registers as humanoid the way a cathedral registers as a building: technically accurate, spiritually insufficient.

The light wraps around it. Clings. You can't make out features—just the *shape* of something that stands on two legs and has two arms and possesses a head, all rendered in a darkness so complete it looks like a hole cut in the amber glow. A silhouette that drinks photons the way the guardian-entities drank **Goro's** shield light.

But this isn't chitin. This isn't an insect-god commanding a hive.

This is something else entirely.

---

Your Status window detonates.

Not a flicker. Not the half-second glitch you've been swatting away like a persistent fly. A full, sustained *cascade*:

`[sudo access requested]`
`[anchor detected]`
`[compatible vessel identified]`
`[FIELD CONTACT: unknown entity — class NULL]`
`[c̶l̷a̵s̷s̶ ̵N̸U̶L̸L̵ ̷=̶ ̸c̸l̶a̷s̵s̷ ̵N̷O̸N̴E̸?̶]`
`[resolving...]`

The text hangs in your vision for three full seconds. Longer than any previous glitch. Long enough to read. Long enough to *understand*.

Then:

`[Class: None]`

Gone. The window is normal. Dormant. Lying to you with its usual straight face.

---

The silhouette in the amber light doesn't move. Doesn't speak. But the structural hum of the forest—the one that dropped in pitch, the one that went silent—returns. Different now. Not a drone. A *frequency*. A single, sustained note that matches—*exactly* matches—the harmonic signature your emitter just fed into the gate.

It heard you tune the instrument.

It came to meet the musician.

---

**Mori's** scanner emits a sound you've never heard it make. A soft, ascending tone—not an alarm, not an error. A chime. The sound it makes when it identifies a registered Guild signal.

She looks at the readout. The blood drains from her face.

> *"That's not possible."*

> *"What."*

> *"It's... it's reading as a* ***gate.****"* Her voice is barely a whisper. *"That thing is reading as a gate. A stable, active, registered-frequency spatial gate. But it's... it's not an opening. It's..."*

She looks up at the silhouette. At the darkness shaped like a person. At the hole in the light that stands thirty meters away in an alien forest on an uncharted Colony world and hums at 8.1 terahertz.

> *"...it's a* ***person.****"*

---

The amber column flares. The silhouette takes one step forward. The ground sighs again. The fractal branches overhead curl—not away this time, but *toward* it, reaching, the way plants reach toward the sun.

Twenty meters now.

**Goro** makes it to both feet. No shield. No mana. Just a big man with a cracked heart standing in front of four people because that's where the tank stands, even when the tank is empty.

> *"Gofer..."* He doesn't look back. His voice shakes. *"...please tell me you've got something left in that pack."*

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

A gate-entity shaped like a person is approaching. Thirty-six hours on the rift. Twenty-one on the clock. Your scanner says it's impossible. Your Status window is having a conversation you weren't invited to. The party is broken, drained, and looking at you.

- **Hold your ground and let it approach** — It hasn't attacked. The hum matches your gate frequency. It responded to the emitter, not to a threat. Maybe this isn't a predator. Maybe it's an answer.
- **Step forward. Alone.** — Your mana signature is zero. Your class is None. The System just called you a *compatible vessel*. If this thing wants to talk, it's not talking to the D-Rankers. It's talking to you.
- **Order the party to fall back to the gate** — Put the rift at your backs. If this goes wrong, you push them through and buy time. The math on that plan is ugly, but the math on everything tonight has been ugly.

*The silhouette takes another step. Fifteen meters. The forest hums its single, perfect note.*

*The holo-emitter in the gate field is dark. The recording is gone. But your chest is still warm.*

*Not the emitter. Something else.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 40)

Step forward. Alone. — My mana signature is zero. My class is None. The System just called you a compatible vessel. If this thing wants to talk, it's not talking to the D-Rankers. It's talking to you.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 41)

### 🚶 The Gofer Walks

You put your hand on **Goro's** shoulder.

Not to steady him. To move him aside.

He's two hundred and twenty pounds of cracked armor and cardiac damage, planted in the dirt like a fence post with a death wish, and your hand—thin-fingered, callused from pack straps, the weakest hand on this planet by every metric the System tracks—presses against his pauldron and pushes. Gently. The way you'd move a curtain.

He moves.

He doesn't mean to. His legs do it on their own—a half-step sideways, an instinct older than pride—and by the time his brain catches up, you're already past him. Walking. Not running. Not creeping. Walking, the way a man walks to the corner store at two in the morning because the milk's gone and the errand won't do itself.

> *"Gofer—what are you—"*

> *"Stay."*

One word. You don't turn around. Your boots press shallow crescents into the alien soil—cool, damp, alive in ways that soil hasn't been alive anywhere you've ever stood. Forty-three kilograms of pack on your spine. CON 7 in every aching joint. The taste of copper fading from your tongue, replaced by something older. Petrichor. Ozone. The electric sweetness of air that has never been filtered through a station recycler.

Behind you, four D-Rank hunters watch an Unawakened man walk toward a god.

---

### 👁️ What They See

**Mori** doesn't stop him.

She should. Every protocol, every year of training, every reflex she's honed in a career built on calculated risk—all of it screams to grab the civilian, pull him behind the combat line, put bodies between the threat and the man with no class and no mana and no reason to be walking *toward* the thing that makes her scanner sing frequencies that shouldn't exist.

She doesn't move.

Later—much later, in a debriefing room on Phobos she'll never fully remember reaching—she'll try to explain why. The words won't come. The closest she'll get is this: *He walked like he already knew.*

Not knew what it was. Not knew what it wanted. Knew the *distance*. Knew the exact number of steps between himself and the thing in the amber light, and had calculated—in the time it takes a normal person to blink—that those steps were his to take. That the math had been done. That the answer was him.

---

**Goro** watches from one knee. Shield arm hanging. Heart still hammering its penance against his ribs—170, 165, the Cardizem pulling him back from the edge one reluctant beat at a time. The amber column of light paints the Gofer's silhouette against the alien treeline, and for a disorienting moment, **Goro** can't tell which figure is the entity and which is the man.

They're both thin. Both dark against the light. Both walking with the unhurried certainty of something that doesn't need to rush because the universe will wait.

> *"...He's going to die,"* **Goro** whispers.

> *"No,"* **Mori** says. She doesn't know why she says it. *"He's not."*

---

### 🌌 Fifteen Meters

The structural hum of the forest rises to meet you. Not louder—*closer*. Like the sound is leaning in. Curious. The fractal branches overhead curl inward, their bioluminescent tips brightening as you pass beneath them—amber warming to gold, gold bleeding to white, a corridor of living light opening step by step as if the forest itself is clearing a path.

Ten meters.

The silhouette sharpens. Details emerge from the darkness like a photograph developing in real time. Not chitin. Not armor. *Skin*—if skin could be made of compressed starlight and the memory of gravitational collapse. Dark. Impossibly smooth. Light doesn't reflect off it; light *ends* at its surface, swallowed whole, leaving only the shape. The outline. The suggestion of a face where a face should be—two points of radiance set deep in the featureless dome of its head, burning the cold amber of dying suns.

It's looking at you.

Not at the D-Rankers behind you. Not at the gate, or the forest, or the twin moons observing from the horizon like umpires at a game they didn't agree to officiate.

*You.*

---

Five meters.

The hum changes. That single, sustained 8.1 terahertz note—the frequency your dead emitter fed into the gate, the frequency the Guild uses to stabilize spatial apertures across the solar system—*bends*. Harmonics appear. Overtones. A chord building from a single note, complex and resonant, and you feel it not in your ears but in the space behind your sternum where the emitter used to press warm against your chest.

It's still warm there. Warmer.

Your Status window doesn't flicker this time.

It *opens*.

```

### 🌟 Contact

Two meters.

The entity looks down at you. You look up at it. The amber points of its eyes are not hostile. Not kind. Not anything you have a taxonomy for. They observe you with the detached precision of a phenomenon encountering another phenomenon—two equations meeting in a variable space, each one checking the other's work.

The chord in the air reaches its resolution. Every overtone collapses into a single, perfect tone—not 8.1 terahertz anymore, not the Guild standard, but something beneath it. Older. A frequency that was here before the gates, before the Guild, before the System decided to start sorting humans into ranks like mail into boxes.

The entity extends one hand.

Not a blade-limb. Not a weapon. A *hand*—five digits, dark as the event horizon of a collapsed star, open-palmed, facing up. The universal gesture. The one that means the same thing in every language, on every world, across every gulf of space and biology and incomprehension:

*Here.*

---

The warmth behind your sternum flares.

Not the emitter. The emitter is dead, wedged into the gate field twenty meters behind you, burning itself out to keep a hole in the universe from healing. This warmth is *yours*. Has always been yours. The banked heat of a thousand dungeon runs where you carried the packs and counted the steps and memorized the bestiaries and *never once* let the System give you what it wanted to give you—because the cost was always too high, because the fine print always took something you couldn't afford to lose, because **Belial** needed you broke and invisible and *alive*, not powerful and dead.

Two years of compounded potential. Every encounter. Every gate. Every signature you catalogued, every pattern you mapped, every time the System whispered *class upgrade available* and you closed the window because you needed to buy medicine, not power.

All of it. Sitting in the vault of your Status window like a savings account that's been accruing interest since the day you decided to be nothing.

The entity's hand waits. Patient. It has the patience of geology. Of stellar formation. Of things that measure time in the drift of continents and the death of suns.

---

Behind you—distant now, another world away, though the distance is only twenty meters—you hear **Goro's** voice. Small and confused and very, very human:

> *"Why isn't it attacking him?"*

And **Reika**, quieter:

> *"...I don't think it came here to attack anyone."*

And **Daisuke**, barely a whisper, his System interface flickering with data that shouldn't exist:

> *"His readout... his readout is all question marks too. But they're not errors. They're... the System is* ***waiting*** *for something. Like it needs his* ***permission.****"*

---

And **Mori**. Silent. Scanner lowered. Watching a scrawny, hollow-cheeked Gofer stand beneath an alien sky with his hand at his side and a god's palm open in front of him, and understanding—with the cold, absolute clarity of a woman who has spent her life reading the unreadable—that she is witnessing something she will never be able to put in a report.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The entity's hand is open. The System is waiting for your permission. Behind your sternum, two years of banked potential hums at a frequency that matches the chord in the alien air. The door has always been open. You were the one who chose to knock.

- **Take its hand** — Accept the contact. Let the circuit close. The System is asking permission, and you've spent two years saying no. Twenty-one hours and twenty-three minutes until **Belial's** next dose. Maybe it's time to say yes. Maybe it always was.

- **Speak first** — You don't take anything without reading the terms. Not anymore. Open your mouth. Ask what it is. Ask what it wants. Ask what the cost is. There is *always* a cost.

- **Turn around and walk back** — The gate is stable. You have thirty-six hours. You don't need this. You don't need whatever the System is selling. You need to get four broken hunters through a dungeon full of chitin and back to Phobos. You need to buy medicine. You need to go *home*.

*The hand waits. The stars watch. Somewhere in the vault of your Status window, a number too large to display ticks upward by one.*

*Twenty-one hours. Twenty-two minutes.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 42)

"The gate is stable. I have thirty-six hours. I don't need this. I don't need whatever the System is selling. I need to get four broken hunters through a dungeon full of chitin and back to Phobos. I need to buy medicine. I need to go home."

I say it out loud, but not to the entity or to my party. Like the thoughts leaking out while working through an equation. Like I was talking to another me who doesn't have time for any of this.

But I can feel it. Something's changed and there's no going back. I don't me to home--because I'll DEFINITELY be going back there, within the next 21 hours and twenty-one minutes. There's no going back to who I was before I stepped into the Phobos dungeon. Back to being the unawakened gofer that tolerates being looked down on, because no one puts the incompetent wretch on the front line. This party is only alive because of me, and I have to take responsibility for that. Belial deserves more than a desparate grasp for the bare minimum. I have to take responsibility for that. My life was saved by someone whose time was measured in lives saved and miracles achieved. I have to take responsibility for that.

After 43 seconds of silence since my last muttering, I say aloud "I have to take responsibility." and I grab its hand.

### 🌑 Forty-Three Seconds

The forest counts them with you. You know because the bioluminescence pulses in one-second intervals—amber, dark, amber, dark—a metronome made of alien photochemistry, steady as a resting heartbeat. The entity's hand hangs in the air between you. Patient. A question asked in flesh and starlight, waiting for an answer in a language older than words.

You're not thinking.

That's not true. You're *always* thinking. The math never stops. But for forty-three seconds, the equations running through your head aren't about gate harmonics or adrenaline dosages or the declining half-life of **Panacea** in a body that's been fighting stage IV cellular degeneration for nineteen months. For forty-three seconds, the only calculation is this:

*Who do I owe?*

---

The answer comes in faces.

**Belial.** Sitting on the edge of a hospital bed. Hair still long. Gown slipping off one shoulder. Forty-one seconds of her that you just burned to keep a hole in the sky from closing. She deserves more than a man who comes home empty-handed and calls it victory. She deserves more than the bare minimum purchased one day at a time by a husband who chose weakness as a financial strategy.

**The surgeon.** You never learned her name. Mars General, third floor, the night **Belial** coded for the second time. The woman who materialized from wherever gods live when they aren't saving lives and spent eleven hours stitching your wife back together with hands that could have been doing *anything else*. A person whose time was measured in lives saved and miracles achieved—and she spent eleven hours of it on a stranger married to a Gofer.

And now: four D-Rankers standing in alien dirt behind you, alive because a pack-mule knew which vial to throw and which vein to hit.

---

The forty-third second ends.

> *"I have to take responsibility."*

You say it the way you'd read a waveform. Flat. Declarative. The voice of a man stating a measurement, not making a speech. Six words. Seventeen syllables. The smallest, quietest revolution in the history of a System that has Awakened millions.

You grab its hand.

---

### ⚡ Contact

The entity's palm is not warm. Not cold. It is the *temperature of math*—the precise, neutral absence of thermal bias that you'd find at absolute equilibrium, where energy neither enters nor exits because the equation is already balanced.

Your fingers close around it.

Its fingers close around yours.

The circuit completes.

---

Nothing happens.

For one full second—an eternity in a moment calibrated to nanoseconds—absolutely nothing happens. The forest hums. The gate breathes. The twin moons stare. Your heart beats once, and in the space between that beat and the next, you have time to think: *I was wrong. It was nothing. I'm still nothing. The math was wrong for the first time in my—*

Then the System stops lying.

### 💻 Overflow

Your Status window doesn't flicker. Doesn't glitch. Doesn't stutter or corrupt or play its usual game of showing you something terrifying for a tenth of a second before retreating behind `[Class: None]` like a coward.

It *detonates*.

```
[sudo access — GRANTED]
```

The text burns. Not on your retina—*behind* it. In the architecture of your visual cortex, in the place where the System has been writing its quiet little lies for two years. The font changes. The UI changes. The entire framework of the window you've been staring at since your first dungeon run *peels back* like wallpaper over a cathedral, and what's underneath is—

```
[COMPOUNDED EXPERIENCE VAULT — UNLOCKING]
[calculating...]
[calculating...]
[calculating...]
```

---

You feel it start in your fingers. Where your skin meets the entity's palm. Not heat—*data*. A torrent of it. Every gate you've ever stood beside. Every dungeon you've ever mapped. Every harmonic frequency you catalogued, every bestiary entry you memorized, every patrol pattern you clocked, every ecological system you reverse-engineered while the hunters you carried gear for walked past you like furniture.

Seven hundred and thirty-one days. Forty-three dungeon runs. A hundred and twelve gate transits. Two years of being the most observant, most knowledgeable, most *invisible* person in every room—and the System logged every second of it. Counted it. Compounded it. Accrued interest on interest on interest, a savings account denominated in a currency that doesn't have a name because *no one has ever done this before*.

No one has ever refused Awakening for two years and kept *working*.

### 🌊 The Dam

It breaks.

Not with an explosion. Not with a flash of golden light and angelic choirs and the dramatic orchestral swell that the stories promise. It breaks the way real things break—a crack that starts small, spider-webbing outward through every load-bearing wall in the structure of who you are, and then the whole architecture shifts, and the water comes, and there is no stopping it.

Your knees don't buckle. They should. CON 7 should put you on the ground. But CON 7 is a number on a page, and the page is *being rewritten*, and the thing rewriting it doesn't care about the old math.

The entity's amber eyes flare. Not brighter—*deeper*. Holes opening behind holes, recursion without end, and in the depths of that impossible geometry you see something that your WIS 18 can barely parse: recognition. The look of a phenomenon that has been standing beside an open door for a very long time, watching a very stubborn man insist on knocking.

```
[Level 3 → Level 4]
[Level 4 → Level 7]
[Level 7 → Level 13]
[Level 13 → Level ██]
```

The numbers climb. Not like a staircase—like a *launch*. Each level consuming the next, the compounded experience burning through thresholds the way fire burns through paper, each breakthrough feeding the next in a chain reaction that the System's display can't render fast enough. The numbers blur. Smear. Stack on top of each other like a flipbook running at a thousand frames per second.

---

And then they stop.

```
[Level: ██]
[Class: ...]
```

The ellipsis hangs. Three dots. The same three dots from before—the System reaching for a word and running out of language. It cycles. You feel it cycling, the way you'd feel a hard drive searching, an engine turning over, a mind on the tip of a thought it can't quite—

```
[Class: Gatekeeper]
```

No.

```
[Class: Architect]
```

No.

```
[Class: Syste█ Adm█n██trat—]
```

*No.*

The words appear and dissolve, appear and dissolve—each one a box too small for the thing it's trying to contain. The System is a filing cabinet, and what's standing in its intake office is an ocean. You feel the struggle in your teeth, in the stuttering warmth behind your sternum, in the way the entity's grip tightens—not painfully, but precisely, the way you'd hold a vial of something volatile while the solution stabilized.

```
[Class: ...]
[Class: ...]
[Class: ...]
```

And then, quietly—so quietly it feels like a secret told between systems that have known each other longer than either has known you—

```
[Class: Threshold]
```

It stays.

### 👁️ What They See

**Mori** is the first to register that something is wrong with the light.

The amber column pouring through the canopy gap doesn't change color. Doesn't brighten. What it does is worse: it *bends*. Curves inward toward the point where the Gofer's hand meets the entity's palm, like the photons themselves are being pulled off course by something with more gravitational authority than the twin moons overhead. The shadows on the forest floor—rust and blue, overlapping, familiar—begin to rotate. Slowly. Then not slowly.

> *"What's... what's happening to him?"* **Daisuke** whispers.

His System interface—the same one that's been showing question marks since they landed—erupts. Data floods the display. Not his data. Not party readouts. *Raw system telemetry*—numbers and characters in a format he's never seen, scrolling faster than he can read, as if the System itself is having a conversation and forgot to close the blinds.

> *"I'm getting... I'm reading... this doesn't..."*

He trails off. His buff aura, dead since the transit, flares back to life—unbidden, uncast, golden light surging from his palms and dispersing into the air like pollen. Not directed at anyone. The System is *overflowing*, and his support-class toolkit is catching the runoff.

---

**Reika** takes one step forward. Her mana-blade, dark at her hip for the last ten minutes, ignites.

Not the sputtering, unsteady flicker of a weapon struggling to function on an unregistered world. A solid, clean, singing edge—brighter than she's ever seen it, humming at a frequency that matches the chord filling the forest, as if the blade is tuning itself to whatever is pouring out of the man standing two meters away from her.

She stares at it. Then at him. Then at the light bending around him like he's the drain at the center of a sink.

> *"...That's not a buff,"* she says. To no one. To herself. *"That's not a buff. That's not a—what IS that?"*

---

**Goro** sees it differently.

He sees it from one knee, shield arm hanging, heart still ticking its penance at 160 beats per minute. He sees it from the vantage of a man who has spent his career measuring threats by their mana output—because that's what tanks do, that's the *job*, you read the room's energy signature and you put yourself between the biggest number and the people behind you.

The Gofer's mana signature has been zero since the moment **Goro** met him. Background noise. Static. The energetic equivalent of an empty room.

It is no longer zero.

It is no longer a number he has a frame of reference for.

**Goro Senta** has stood in front of B-Rank dungeon bosses. He has braced his shield against the mana-flare of a rampaging Tunnel Raptor alpha and held his ground through sheer, stubborn, subscription-model willpower. He knows what power feels like when it pushes against your skin—the pressure, the heat, the animal panic of standing downwind from something that could unmake you.

This is not that.

This is the feeling of standing at the base of a dam and hearing the concrete groan. Not the water. Not the force. The *scale*—the horrifying, vertiginous apprehension of volume, of a quantity so vast that the structure containing it has become irrelevant. You don't fear the wave. You fear the fact that there was ever a wall stupid enough to try holding it back.

> *"...Mori."*

His voice is very small.

> *"Mori, what is he?"*

---

**Mori** doesn't answer.

Her scanner has shut off. Not crashed—*shut off*. Voluntarily. The power indicator is green, the battery is full, and the device has decided, with the self-preserving wisdom of a small machine in the presence of something very large, to go to sleep and wait for the storm to pass.

She's holding it in both hands. Staring at the dark screen. Then she looks up, and she watches the scrawny, hollow-cheeked, Class-None Gofer—the man who carried their packs and organized their vials and saved their lives with expired medical supplies and a bottle of raptor piss—stand in the center of a bending pillar of alien light with his hand in a god's grip and the System rewriting itself around him like the universe is correcting a typo it made two years ago.

Her mouth opens. Closes.

She was the one who noticed when **Goro** stepped back without meaning to.

She is the one who notices that she is crying without meaning to.

---

### 🌅 Aftermath

The entity releases your hand.

Not abruptly. Gently. The way you'd set down something fragile after confirming it wouldn't break. Its amber eyes meet yours one last time—and this close, this calibrated, you see what's in them.

Not intelligence. Not malice. Not benevolence.

*Completion.*

The look of a circuit that has been waiting for its final component.

It steps back. One step. Two. The amber column of light follows it, retreating, the canopy irising closed overhead as the fractal branches unfurl back into their resting geometry. The bioluminescence dims—amber to rust, rust to ember, ember to the faint, ambient glow of a forest settling back into its baseline state. The structural hum fades. Not gone—present, always present, woven into the fabric of this world—but quiet now. The held breath, released.

The entity doesn't vanish. It *recedes*—walking back into the treeline with the unhurried gait of something that has finished the task it was made for and has nowhere else to be. The darkness swallows it by degrees. Shoulders. Torso. Head. The last thing to disappear is the faint amber glow of its eyes, hanging in the black between the fractal trunks like a pair of dying stars.

Then it's gone.

The forest is quiet.

---

You stand in the clearing. Your hand is at your side. Your fingers are tingling—not with power, not with residual energy, but with the simple, physical aftermath of holding something tightly and letting it go.

Your Status window is open. You didn't open it. It opened itself—or perhaps it never closed, perhaps it's been open this whole time and you're only now seeing it clearly, the way you'd see a room clearly after someone finally turned on the lights.

```
[Name: Kami Noteki]
[Class: Threshold]
[Level: ██]
```

The level is still redacted. Blacked out. Not by corruption or error—by *choice*. The System has decided, with the bureaucratic discretion of an institution that has just processed something unprecedented, that this number is not yet ready to be displayed. Not to you. Not to anyone.

Beneath it, a single line:

```
[the door is open]
[what you build on the other side is yours]
```

---

The warmth behind your sternum hasn't faded. It's settled. Banked, like coals after a fire—not burning, but *present*. Ready. Patient in the way that the entity was patient. In the way the System was patient. In the way you have been patient for seven hundred and thirty-one days, carrying forty-three kilograms on a frame built for twenty, because the math said *not yet* and you trusted the math.

The math says *now*.

---

Behind you, silence. The kind that follows a detonation—not the absence of sound, but the *refusal* of sound, as if the air itself needs a moment to remember how to carry noise. Four D-Rank hunters standing in a loose semicircle around a stabilized gate, staring at the back of a man they will never call *Gofer* again. They don't know that yet. But their bodies know—the way **Goro** won't step forward, the way **Reika's** mana-blade dimmed when the light receded as though it had been borrowing something and the loan was called in, the way **Daisuke's** hands have dropped to his sides with his buff aura extinguished because some part of him understands he is no longer the most System-relevant person in this clearing.

**Mori** wipes her face with the back of her wrist. Quick. Efficient. The gesture of a woman who has already decided this didn't happen.

> *"...Noteki."*

First time she's used your name. Not *Gofer*. Not *Kami*. **Noteki.** The way you'd address someone whose rank you suddenly aren't sure of.

> *"The gate's stable. The entity is gone. And your mana signature is..."*

She pauses. Looks at her dead scanner. Looks at you.

> *"...I don't know what your mana signature is. My equipment won't turn on."*

The way she says it—flat, professional, the vocal equivalent of a controlled demolition—tells you everything. The scanner didn't crash. The scanner *hid*. The way small animals hide when something with teeth walks past.

---

The forest hums its low, resting note. The twin moons hang over the treeline. Somewhere in the fractal canopy, the bioluminescence has settled into a new pattern—not tracking, not searching. *Orbiting*. Slow, concentric ripples of amber light radiating outward from the clearing where you stand, as if you've become the stone dropped into a still pond.

Twenty-one hours. Nineteen minutes.

**Belial** is waiting. The dungeon is behind the gate. The chitin swarm, the guardians, the ceiling-entity—all of it between you and Phobos. Between you and the payment. Between you and her.

The pack on your back weighs forty-three kilograms. Same as always. But the spine carrying it doesn't feel the same. Not lighter—*sufficient*. As if the frame and the weight have finally reached an equilibrium that two years of dungeon runs never achieved.

Your hands aren't shaking anymore.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

You are **Kami Noteki**. Class: **Threshold**. Level: unknown. Standing in an alien forest with four shaken hunters, a stabilized gate, and twenty-one hours on the clock. The way back is through the dungeon. Through the swarm. Through the things that almost killed your party thirty minutes ago.

The math has changed.

*You* have changed.

But the equation hasn't: **Belial. Panacea. Twenty-one hours.**

- **Test the new power** — You need to understand what **Threshold** means before you walk back through that gate. The forest is quiet. The entity is gone. Take sixty seconds to open the System, read the fine print, and learn what you've become.

- **Brief the team and move** — Every minute here is a minute burned. The party needs to know enough to follow you, and then you need to go. Back through the gate. Back through the dungeon. Answers can wait. She can't.

- **Ask Mori what she saw** — Her scanner read the entity as a gate. Her scanner just *hid from you*. She's the analyst. She processes data for a living. Before you move, you need her read on what just happened—because the one thing worse than not understanding your own power is misunderstanding it at the wrong moment.

*The coals behind your sternum glow. The forest orbits. The clock ticks.*

*Time to go home.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 44)

What the team just saw needs to stay between us, which means I need to minimize their interreptation. I need to convince them they didn't witness my ascension, that they witnessed a failed attempt to communicate. Honestly, this should be easy. I just let CON 7 take it's hold. I can feel my vision squeezing into blackness. I stop fighting it. 

I'm so far beyond my body's limit. My collapse should lower their expectations, I think as my vision squeezes to pinpoint. To a tunnel vision of only Mori's still-startled, but softening facial expression. 

That's right, you witnessed the unawakened Gofer push himself to an extreme that was beyond him. His reward wasn't cosmic recognition, it was physiological overload. 

Half of that is true, I think as I give in. I do feel overloaded.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 45)

### 🌑 The Lights Go Out

The tunnel vision is a mercy.

**Mori's** face—the only thing left in the shrinking aperture of your consciousness—does exactly what you need it to do. The startled wideness of her eyes softens. Shifts. The analytical rigidity melts into something older and less complicated: *concern*. Plain, human concern for a man who is clearly, visibly, obviously falling apart.

*Good.*

You don't stage the collapse. You don't have to. Your body has been writing this scene for two years—CON 7 directing a one-man show about the limits of human endurance, and all you do is stop ad-libbing the ending. Stop bracing. Stop clenching the muscles in your legs that have been lying to gravity about how much they have left.

The equation is simple: subtract willpower from the load-bearing calculation, and the structure fails.

Your knees go first. Then the horizon tilts—violet sky trading places with black soil in a lazy, drunken pirouette that would be beautiful if you could feel anything other than the warm, velvet pressure of your own blood forgetting which direction to flow.

The last thing you think, with the clinical detachment of a man filing paperwork while the building burns down around him:

*Forty-three kilograms of pack. Aim left. Don't land on the medical kit.*

You land on your left side. The pack absorbs most of the impact. The rest is dirt and darkness and the distant, dimming sound of your name—your real name, or your fake one, you can't tell which—being called by voices that seem to be coming from the bottom of a very deep well.

---

### 👁️ What They See

**Daisuke** reaches him first.

Not because he's fastest—**Reika** is faster, always has been, the mana-edge making her reactions something adjacent to precognition. But **Reika** freezes. Her legs lock. The mana-blade at her hip gutters out for the second time in ten minutes, and she stands rooted in alien dirt, staring at the crumpled shape of the Gofer like a woman watching a building collapse and trying to remember if anyone was still inside.

**Daisuke** doesn't freeze. Support-class instincts—the ones that live beneath the System, beneath the buff auras and the party interface, in the part of the brain that just *moves toward the fallen body*—carry him forward before his conscious mind grants authorization. His knees hit the soil beside the Gofer's head. His hands find the pulse point on the neck. Two fingers. Light pressure. The gesture he performed on **Goro** five minutes ago, when the Gofer told him to stop relying on his System and start relying on his *hands*.

> *"Pulse is... thready. Fast. He's—his body just..."*

**Daisuke** trails off. Swallows. Looks up at **Mori** with an expression she's seen on new hunters when the dungeon stops being a game and starts being a place where people die.

> *"He pushed too far. The transit, the gate, the... whatever that thing was. He's Unawakened. His body can't—he doesn't have mana channels to buffer the—"*

He's explaining it to himself. Building the narrative that makes sense. The one where a brave, stupid, brilliant Gofer walked up to a god on an alien world and his reward was his own circulatory system staging a mutiny.

**Mori** kneels. She pulls the Gofer's pack off with practiced efficiency—velcro straps, buckle, buckle, shoulder harness—forty-three kilograms lifted away like removing a headstone from a grave. She checks his pupils. His breathing. The cooling patch on his neck that he put on **Goro** is the one he should have put on himself.

> *"He's stable,"* she says. Flat. The professional voice. But her hands linger on his collar a half-second longer than triage requires, straightening it for no medical reason.

---

**Goro** hasn't moved.

He's standing—barely, one hand braced against a fractal trunk that curls away from his touch—and he's staring at the place where the entity was. The empty clearing. The residual amber glow fading from the bioluminescent canopy. The absence where something vast and incomprehensible stood and extended its hand to the weakest man on the planet.

> *"It didn't touch him,"* he says. To no one. To the trees. *"He reached for it, and then he just... went down. Like a breaker tripping."*

His voice is the voice of a man looking for the version of events that lets him sleep tonight. He finds it quickly—tanks are good at that. Build the wall. Stand behind it. Don't look at what's on the other side.

> *"Mana exposure. Has to be. That thing was radiating... whatever it was radiating. An Unawakened body takes a dose like that, it's like sticking a fork in a power outlet."*

> *"Yeah,"* **Reika** says. Her voice is small. Distant. She's still staring at the Gofer's crumpled form, and some part of her—the part that felt her mana-blade tune itself to an impossible frequency thirty seconds ago, the part that watched light *bend* around a man with a Class of None—is not convinced.

But she doesn't say it. The thing she almost says dissolves in the humid alien air, replaced by the simpler, safer, more survivable explanation:

*The Gofer overloaded. The Gofer is fragile. The Gofer needs to be carried home.*

She picks up his pack.

Forty-three kilograms. She has to use both hands.

---

### ⏳ The Way Back

You dream of copper.

Not the taste—the *color*. Sheets of it, oxidizing in time-lapse, bright penny-orange corroding to verdigris green while you watch from a distance that has no floor or ceiling. Somewhere in the copper landscape, a Status window opens and closes, opens and closes, a mouth with nothing to say and all the time in the world to say it.

```
[Class: Threshold]
```

Blink.

```
[Class: None]
```

Blink.

```
[Class: Threshold]
```

The window settles. Dims. Tucks itself into a corner of your unconscious like a cat finding a warm spot and deciding to stay.

```
[stealth protocol: ACTIVE]
[display mode: legacy]
[external query response: "None"]
[internal access: FULL]
```

Even asleep, the math runs. Even asleep, the System does what it's told.

---

You surface in fragments.

**Goro's** voice, vibrating through the chest you're draped against. He's carrying you. Fireman's carry—your head against his shoulder blade, your legs pinned under one massive arm, the other arm holding a shield that barely flickers. The blue hexagons are cracked. Dim. But they're *there*, and they're facing forward, and the sound of clicking chitin is all around you but *distant*. Retreating. The swarm pressing back against the walls of the Phobos cavern like a tide reversing itself, not fleeing exactly, but *yielding*—and some part of your unconscious brain notes this and files it and wonders what it means that the hive seems to be opening a corridor.

> *"Reika, left side—two of them—"*

> *"I see them."*

The wet sound of a mana-blade finding chitin. Brief. Efficient. **Reika** isn't fighting with desperation anymore. She's fighting with the residual harmonic of a weapon that remembers what it felt like to be tuned to a god's frequency, and even the memory of that tuning is enough to make a Crawler's armor part like wet paper.

She doesn't notice. Doesn't question why her blade is sharper than it's ever been. Adrenaline. That's all. Adrenaline and survival instinct. The simple explanation. The safe one.

---

Then light. Real light. The clinical, filtered, recycled-air light of a **Phobos Station** transit corridor. The gate—the *registered* gate, the one with the Guild-maintained frequency and the clean 3.7-second transit time—spits you back into civilization with the unceremonious efficiency of a system processing routine traffic.

**Goro** sets you down on a bench. Your head lolls. Your eyes open to fluorescent tubes and stamped-metal ceiling tiles and the distant, tinny announcement of a gate status update on the station PA.

You're back.

---

### 🌧️ Phobos Rain

Six hours later, you are sitting in a noodle joint on Sublevel 4 that smells like burnt soy sauce and resignation.

The rain on Phobos isn't real. You know this. Everyone knows this. The atmospheric regulators cycle precipitation through the station's environmental shell on a twenty-six-hour schedule—a simulacrum of weather designed to prevent the psychological deterioration that comes from living inside a metal tube orbiting a dead rock. The droplets that streak the noodle joint's window are chemically balanced, temperature-controlled, and precisely as melancholy as a committee of environmental psychologists intended them to be.

They still make the glass look like it's crying.

Your reflection stares back at you from the wet pane. Hollow-cheeked. Dark circles deep enough to lose change in. The same face you've been wearing for two years—Gofer face, furniture face, the face of a man the universe has agreed to stop noticing.

Behind that face, the coals glow.

```
[Class: Threshold]
[stealth protocol: ACTIVE]
```

You close the window. Sip your broth. The noodles are the cheap ones—synth-wheat, no egg, the kind that taste like apology. Twelve credits. You have forty-seven left after the gate transit fee, and **Belial's** next **Panacea** dose costs—

The door opens.

---

### 🐍 The Collector

You smell him before you see him.

Cologne. Not the good kind—the kind that comes in a bottle shaped like a fist, sold at station kiosks next to protein bars and novelty keychains. It fills the narrow restaurant like a chemical spill, displacing the burnt soy sauce and replacing it with something worse: the scent of a man who thinks he's expensive.

**Tomas Vek.** Syndicate collections. Mid-thirties. Suit that costs more than your annual dungeon earnings, tailored to emphasize shoulders that have never carried anything heavier than a grudge. Hair slicked with product that catches the fluorescent light and throws it back in your eyes like a petty insult. He moves through the noodle joint the way collection agents move through everything—like the air is rented and you're behind on the payments.

Two men behind him. Bigger. Quieter. The kind of men who communicate primarily through the medium of standing near you in a way that implies consequences.

**Vek** slides into the booth across from you. Uninvited. His elbows land on the sticky counter with the familiarity of a man who has had this conversation in a hundred identical restaurants on a hundred identical sublevels with a hundred identical nobodies who owe his employers money.

> *"Noteki. Kami."*

He says your name the way you'd read an invoice. Flat. Itemized. He pulls a data-pad from his jacket—newer than yours, uncracked, probably worth more than this restaurant and everyone in it.

> *"You're four days past due on your supplemental interest payment. Sixteen thousand credits."* A smile. Teeth too white. *"We've been patient."*

---

The counter is sticky under your forearms. The synth-noodles are going cold. The rain paints the window in streaks that look like the bar graphs of a declining credit balance, and **Tomas Vek** is sitting across from you with the relaxed posture of a man who has never once been afraid of the person on the other side of the table.

He shouldn't be afraid. He's looking at a Gofer. Class: None. Level 3 on the public record. A man who carries packs for D-Rankers and can't afford egg in his noodles. The lowest possible threat. A rounding error in the Syndicate's ledger.

Behind your sternum, the coals shift.

```
[Class: Threshold]
```

You close the window.

> *"I'll have it by tomorrow,"* you say. The Gofer voice. Tired. Thin. The voice of a man who has been making this promise to this kind of person for as long as he can remember. *"The run paid out. I just need to process the—"*

> *"Tomorrow."* **Vek** leans back. The booth creaks. His cologne assaults the air with renewed enthusiasm. *"See, I've heard 'tomorrow' from you... what is it now..."*

He makes a show of scrolling through his data-pad. The screen reflects in the wet window, and you can see the file. Your file. Every payment. Every missed deadline. Every extension granted with interest compounded at rates that would make a loan shark blush.

> *"Seven times. Seven 'tomorrows.' And every time, you scrape it together, just barely, like a rat finding the last crumb in a drain. It's actually impressive, in a sad kind of way."*

He leans forward. The smile widens. The teeth get whiter.

> *"But my employers are starting to wonder if the crumbs are going to run out. And when that happens—"*

The door opens again.

---

**Goro Senta** fills the doorframe the way a cork fills a bottle.

He's cleaned up. Mostly. The armor's been swapped for civilian clothes—a jacket that strains across his shoulders, boots that have seen better decades. The cooling patch is gone from his neck, but the bruising underneath is still visible: a mottled purple-yellow necklace of burst capillaries, the receipt from three needles of **Adrenacor-9** administered by a Gofer who was betting his heart could take it.

He sees you. Sees **Vek**. Sees the two quiet men standing behind **Vek** like bookends with fists.

His jaw sets.

> *"Gofer. You left the station without checking out your share."*

He holds up a credit chit. Walks to the booth. His eyes haven't left **Vek**.

> *"Am I interrupting something?"*

---

**Vek** looks up at **Goro**. Runs the calculation. D-Rank hunter. Big. Intimidating to civilians. To the Syndicate—a speed bump. The two men behind **Vek** don't even shift their weight.

> *"Private financial matter,"* **Vek** says. The smile doesn't falter. *"Your friend here owes my employers some money. We're discussing payment terms. Like adults."*

He turns back to you. The smile sharpens.

> *"Unless you need your* ***hunter*** *to fight your bills for you too? That how it works? You carry their bags, they carry your debts?"*

The word *hunter* lands exactly where he aims it. In the space between you and **Goro**. In the taxonomy that separates people with power from people without it. **Vek** has done his homework. He knows what a Gofer is. He knows what it means—the hierarchy, the dependence, the quiet transaction of dignity for survival.

The noodle broth reflects the fluorescent lights. The rain taps the glass. Somewhere in the back of the restaurant, a cook scrapes a wok across a burner with the shriek of metal-on-metal, and the sound makes your teeth ache, and behind the ache, in the space where a cheap holo-emitter used to press warm against your chest—

The coals *flare*.

Not visible. Not detectable. Nothing that **Vek** or his bookends or their data-pads or their cologne could ever register. But you feel it—the banked potential humming at a frequency that could shatter every window on this sublevel if you let it out. The **Threshold** pressing against the inside of your skin like a fist inside a glove, patient and vast and utterly, perfectly still.

```
[Class: Threshold]
[Level: ██]
[stealth protocol: ACTIVE]
[query: "threat assessment — Tomas Vek"]
[response: irrelevant]
```

*Irrelevant.*

The System doesn't even bother with a number.

---

**Goro's** knuckles are white on the credit chit. His jaw is a granite shelf. He's looking at **Vek** the way a man looks at a stain he wants to scrub out of existence, and the vein in his temple—the same one that almost burst six hours ago when his heart hit 220—is beginning to throb.

> *"Say that again."*

It's not a request.

**Vek** raises an eyebrow. Amused. The confidence of a man who has an entire criminal organization behind him and has never once been in a fight that wasn't already over before it started.

The two quiet men shift their weight. Slightly. Professionally.

The rain falls. The wok shrieks. The noodles go cold.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

A Syndicate collection agent is humiliating you in a noodle joint on Phobos while **Goro** teeters between protective fury and cardiac episode. You have sixteen thousand credits of debt, forty-seven credits in your account, and a power inside you that registers **Tomas Vek** as *irrelevant*. But every second you stay visible is a second the mask risks slipping.

- **Defuse Goro** — Put your hand on his arm. Tell him it's fine. Let **Vek** have his moment. Swallow it. You've swallowed worse. The debt is real, the timeline is real, and a D-Ranker starting a fight with the Syndicate helps no one—least of all **Belial**.

- **Pay the man** — Take the credit chit from **Goro**. If the dungeon run payout covers the sixteen thousand, hand it over. Clear the debt. Remove the leverage. It's money you need for **Panacea**, but a Syndicate tail is a complication you can't afford either.

- **Look Vek in the eyes and say nothing** — Don't defuse. Don't pay. Just... *look* at him. Let the silence do the work. Let the man who has never been afraid of a Gofer sit across from you in a sticky booth and feel, for the first time in his career, that something about the math isn't adding up. You won't use the power. You won't even hint at it. But you won't perform weakness for him either. Not anymore.

*The rain falls. The coals glow. Sixteen hours and forty-three minutes.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 46)

I stand and place my arm on Goro's shoulder. "Thank you, Goro. You didn't have to bring it to me yourself, but I appreciate that you did. That makes this easier."

I tap my cracked data pad to the credit chit in Goro's hand; authorizing the transfer. Then I hold out the pad to Vek. 

"I pay my debts, Vek. I'm good for business and you know it."

That smile of his. Like a cartoon shark. Before the boasting begins--he'll claim his victory loudly, it's in his nature--but after he reaches for his own pad, I smuggle the beg in "And I need another 24k for tomorrow"

#### 🎭 DM (Message 47)

### 💰 Good For Business

You stand. Not fast. Not slow. The speed of a man who has done this particular dance before and knows where the steps go.

Your hand lands on **Goro's** shoulder. Light. Brief. The way you'd steady a shelf that's about to topple.

> *"Thank you, Goro. You didn't have to bring it to me yourself, but I appreciate that you did."*

His jaw works. The vein in his temple is still ticking its angry metronome, his eyes still pinned on **Vek** like a dog watching a cat it isn't allowed to chase. But your hand is on his shoulder, and some part of him—the part that remembers a cooling patch on his neck, a needle in his arm, ten beats per minute of margin between alive and otherwise—registers the pressure as an instruction.

*Stay.*

> *"That makes this easier."*

---

You tap the cracked data-pad to the credit chit. The transfer chirps—a thin, digital sound, almost apologetic, like the device knows the numbers passing through it represent something more than money. The chit had more on it than your usual split. Hazard bonus. The anomaly run triggered the Guild's irregular-encounter multiplier, and someone—**Mori**, probably, with her quiet efficiency and her reports filed in triplicate—made sure the Gofer's share wasn't rounded down.

Sixteen thousand, four hundred credits. Enough.

You hold the pad out to **Vek**. Screen-first. The transaction authorization glowing sickly green in the fluorescent light, the number displayed in a font designed by someone who understood that debt collection is, at its core, a visual medium.

> *"I pay my debts, Vek. I'm good for business and you know it."*

---

**Vek** takes the pad. Not immediately—he lets it hang in the air for a beat, the way a cat lets a mouse run three steps before swatting it back. Power dynamics. The choreography of asymmetric transactions, rehearsed until the cruelty looks like manners.

Then he takes it.

His thumb swipes the authorization. The screen flashes. Confirmed. Sixteen thousand credits evaporate from your account like water on a hot plate, and the sickly green light reflects off **Vek's** teeth as the shark-smile widens into something almost genuine. Almost.

> *"See?"* He leans back. Spreads his arms. The booth creaks under the gesture, his cologne expanding to fill the space his ego has just claimed. *"This. THIS is what I'm always telling them. 'The Gofer pays.' They say, 'Tomas, he's a dead-end, cut him loose.' And I say—"*

He points at you with the data-pad. Your data-pad. In his hand.

> *"—'This man is a professional.' You know what that's worth? In this economy? On this rock?"*

---

Here. The gap. The breath between **Vek's** inhale and the next sentence of a monologue that could run for six minutes if you let it—you've timed him before, three separate occasions, average duration five minutes forty-two seconds with a standard deviation of eighteen seconds. He boasts the way other men breathe: compulsively, rhythmically, and with no awareness of who's still listening.

He reaches for his own pad. Right hand. Left hand still holding yours. His eyes on **Goro**—checking whether the big man is impressed, is intimidated, is *acknowledging* the performance. **Vek** always plays to the largest audience member. Literally.

You slide it in like a knife between ribs.

> *"And I need another 24k for tomorrow."*

---

Same voice. Same register. The Gofer voice—tired, thin, the vocal equivalent of a man checking a box on a form. You say it the way you'd say *and a side of rice*. The way you'd say *floor twelve, please*. Buried in the slipstream of **Vek's** own ego, tucked between his last boast and his next one, so the words hit his ears without tripping any of the alarms that a more careful man would have installed.

**Vek's** thumb pauses over his pad. One second. His eyes flick back to you.

The shark-smile doesn't waver. If anything, it deepens—the expression of a predator who has just been offered more prey and is politely deciding how grateful to appear.

> *"Twenty-four."* He rolls the number around in his mouth like a hard candy. *"That's a jump, Noteki. That's a significant jump from your usual—"*

> *"Equipment upgrade,"* you say. Flat. Pre-loaded. The lie you prepared three hours ago while unconscious on an alien world, because even in the copper-tinted dreamscape of systemic reformatting, some part of your brain was already planning this conversation. *"Better gear, better runs, better returns. Your employers see the math."*

---

**Vek** looks at you. Really looks—the first honest assessment he's made since he sat down. His eyes do what collection agents' eyes do: they appraise. Not the person. The *investment*. The risk profile. The probability curve of repayment graphed against the interest rate and the cost of enforcement.

He sees what he's always seen. A thin man with hollow cheeks and a cracked data-pad who has never once—not in seven payments, not in fourteen months—missed a deadline. A man who scrapes. Who scrabbles. Who crawls to the finish line on hands and knees every single time and slides the credits across the counter with nothing left over. Not even enough for egg in his noodles.

Perfect. The perfect debtor. Just solvent enough to bleed, just desperate enough to keep bleeding.

> *"Twenty-four. Twelve percent. Fourteen-day term."*

He taps his pad. Three times. The approval comes faster than the soup.

> *"Don't make me regret being a fan, Noteki."*

---

He slides your data-pad back across the counter. The screen shows the deposit notification: **24,000 credits.** Incoming. Processing. The numbers fill the account balance the way saline fills a dehydrated vein—not enough to fix anything, just enough to keep the system from crashing.

**Vek** stands. Adjusts his jacket. The cologne swirls.

> *"Pleasure. As always."*

He doesn't look at **Goro** on the way out. The two bookend men peel off the wall and follow, their footsteps synchronizing with **Vek's** the way moons synchronize with a planet—gravitationally, automatically, without thought.

The door closes. The soy sauce smell returns. The rain taps the window.

---

### 🌧️ Aftermath

**Goro** hasn't moved.

He's standing beside the booth with one hand still half-raised, holding a credit chit that's now empty, watching the door where **Vek** disappeared with an expression that doesn't have a clean name. It's not anger—the anger came and went, burned through by the cardiac medication still metabolizing in his bloodstream. It's not pity—**Goro** doesn't have the architecture for pity. It's something adjacent to both. Something that lives in the space between *I didn't know* and *I should have*.

> *"...Fourteen percent."*

He says it to the empty booth. To the cold noodles. To the rain on the glass.

> *"That's— Gofer, that's— they're bleeding you. You know that, right? Fourteen on a fourteen-day is—"*

He stops. Runs the math. You can see the exact moment it hits him—the number, the real number, the total cost of being **Kami Noteki** for one more month—because his face does something you've never seen it do.

It goes quiet.

Not angry-quiet. Not swagger-quiet. The kind of quiet that happens when a man who has never thought about money—really *thought* about it, the way you think about it, the way it ticks behind your eyes like a second clock counting down to something that isn't midnight—suddenly understands that the person sitting across from him has been drowning in plain sight for a very long time.

> *"How much do you owe them?"*

---

You pick up your chopsticks. The synth-noodles are cold. They taste like apology and stale soy and twelve credits you'll never see again.

Your data-pad buzzes on the counter.

Not the deposit notification. Something else. A comms packet—fragmented, corrupted, routed through three relay stations and a Mars-to-Phobos bounce that has chewed through the signal like acid through foil. The header reads: **MARS GENERAL — AUTOMATED PATIENT MONITOR — NOTEKI, B.**

You tap it open.

Audio. Eleven seconds. Mostly static—the wet, hissing crackle of a signal that has traveled 9,377 kilometers through a station's recycled atmosphere and arrived more dead than alive. But beneath the static, buried in the noise floor like a coin at the bottom of a well—

A cough.

Not a normal cough. A *structural* sound—wet, splintering, the noise of something breaking inside a chest cavity that was designed to hold together. And under the cough, a secondary frequency that your ears pick up and your brain categorizes before your heart has time to intervene:

Glass. It sounds like glass.

**Belial** coughing up something that sounds like glass.

Eleven seconds. Then silence. Then the automated footer:

`[Patient status: STABLE — next Panacea administration: 15h 47m]`

---

Fifteen hours. Forty-seven minutes. The number has been recalculated since you last checked. Shorter. The treatment window is compressing—the intervals between doses narrowing the way contractions narrow, the body demanding more, more, more of the thing keeping it from unraveling.

The coals behind your sternum pulse. Once. Warm and patient and vast.

```
[Class: Threshold]
[stealth protocol: ACTIVE]
[external query response: "None"]
```

You close the window. You eat your noodles. They're cold.

**Goro** is still standing there. Waiting for an answer you're not going to give him.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The debt is paid. The loan is secured. **Belial's** next dose is covered—barely. But the audio rattles in your skull like a stone in an empty room. Fifteen hours and forty-seven minutes. The treatment window is shrinking. The math is changing.

- **Answer Goro** — He asked how much you owe. He's standing in a noodle joint on Sublevel 4 with an empty credit chit, and for the first time since you've known him, he isn't performing. The question is real. Maybe the answer should be too.

- **Ignore Goro. Call the hospital.** — That cough wasn't in any of the previous patient monitor packets. Something has changed. You need to talk to **Belial's** care team *now*, before the next dose window opens.

- **Head to the Guild office** — The anomaly run data needs to be filed, and the hazard bonus needs to clear before the Syndicate's interest starts compounding. Besides—the Guild's E-Rank board might have something that pays better than Phobos. Something that a man with a new class and a hidden level might find... *trivially profitable.*

*The rain falls. The noodles are cold. The glass-cough echoes in your inner ear like a frequency you can't tune out.*

*Fifteen hours. Forty-seven minutes.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 48)

Between slurps of cold, tasteless noodles I do the math. Compound interest. Add up sums from OTHER bookies. 

The muttering stops for a moment as I find a particularly salty noodle--a treat on my current diet. "four hundred thirty two thousand sevenhundred and fifty... seven." I say like a microwave timer going off. 

"Listen Goro. You're a good man. A great hunter. You saved your party. Hell, you saved my life." I turn to the bartender "Get this man a saki" I say as I tap my pad to the bar. It chirps, the same apologetic sound. 23,992.

"I owe you more than a drink, but this is all I can afford. That and my thanks." I kick back the last of my noodle broth. 

"So thank you." I say as I stand. "I've got another dungeon scheduled for tonight, so if you'll excuse me." I turn and leave.

#### 🎭 DM (Message 49)

### 🍶 The Tab

The number falls out of your mouth between slurps like loose change from a torn pocket.

> *"Four hundred thirty-two thousand seven hundred and fifty... seven."*

You say it the way a coroner reads a time of death. Clinical. Final. The kind of number that stops being money at a certain point and becomes geography—a distance measured in lifetimes of twelve-credit noodles and fourteen-percent interest and a wife whose medication costs more per dose than most people earn in a month.

**Goro** doesn't flinch. He's too busy flinching at everything else.

---

> *"Listen, Goro. You're a good man. A great hunter. You saved your party. Hell, you saved my life."*

The lie lands clean. Surgical. Delivered with the same flat precision you'd use to slot a needle into an antecubital vein—find the opening, depress the plunger, move on. **Goro's** jaw works. Something behind his eyes cracks—a hairline fracture in the wall he's been rebuilding since you pulled him back from 220 BPM on an alien world six hours ago.

He didn't save your life. He knows this. You know he knows. The cooling patch is gone from his neck but the bruise is still there—purple-yellow, the shape of your fingers, a receipt he can't return.

You tap your pad to the bar. It chirps. **23,992.**

> *"Get this man a sake."*

---

The bartender—a thick woman with forearms like bridge cables and the thousand-yard stare of someone who's served drinks on Sublevel 4 long enough to stop counting the bodies—pours without comment. The ceramic cup is chipped. The sake is warm. It costs eight credits, and you don't look at the new number on your pad because looking at it won't change it and you've already done the math.

> *"I owe you more than a drink, but this is all I can afford. That and my thanks."*

You kick back the last of the broth. Cold. Salt-flat. The ghost of a good noodle lingering on your tongue like the memory of a meal you had in a better life.

> *"So thank you."*

You stand. The stool scrapes against tile. A small sound. The kind of sound that fills a room only when the room has gone very, very quiet.

> *"I've got another dungeon scheduled for tonight, so if you'll excuse me."*

You turn. You leave. The door chime rings—a flat, electronic *bing* that the noodle joint has never bothered to replace because replacing things costs money and money is a fiction everyone on Sublevel 4 has agreed to stop believing in.

---

### 🌧️ The Man at the Bar

The rain hits you. Simulated. Perfectly calibrated. Twenty-six-hour cycle. The droplets are 2.3 millimeters in diameter and fall at a terminal velocity calculated by an environmental psychologist who has never once stood on Sublevel 4 and wondered if the water on the window was the glass crying.

You walk. The corridor stretches ahead—gray metal, gray light, gray faces moving in gray directions. Your boots leave wet prints on the deck plating. Your pack is on your back. Forty-three kilograms. The weight hasn't changed, but the spine carrying it holds it differently now—a posture that could be exhaustion, could be something else, could be the quiet architecture of a man who has stopped pretending the load is too heavy and started pretending it's all he can carry.

Behind you, through the noodle joint's rain-streaked window, a shape sits at the bar.

---

**Goro Senta** stares at a cup of sake he didn't pour. Didn't pay for. Didn't earn.

The ceramic is warm in his hands. His hands are the size of dinner plates. They have held shields rated for B-Rank mana discharge. They have punched through Crawler carapace in emergencies where the shield couldn't cycle fast enough. They are hands that have never, in twenty-seven years of being attached to **Goro Senta**, felt *small*.

They feel small now.

He lifts the cup. Doesn't drink. Turns it. The chip in the rim catches the fluorescent light—a tiny imperfection in a vessel that still holds what it's supposed to hold. Like a cracked data-pad. Like a body running CON 7 in a world that demands CON 12 to survive.

> *"You saved my life,"* the Gofer had said.

**Goro** sets the cup down. Picks it up again. Sets it down.

---

The bartender watches him the way bartenders watch everyone—with the detached anthropological interest of a woman who has seen every species of human grief and has stopped trying to classify them.

> *"Your friend left his chopsticks,"* she says.

She holds them up. Disposable. Wooden. Snapped unevenly—one longer than the other, the way they always snap when you pull them apart with hands that are shaking from something other than hunger.

**Goro** takes them. Holds them. Two pieces of wood that cost nothing and weigh nothing and mean nothing.

He puts them in his jacket pocket.

---

The sake is good. Cheap, but good. The kind of good that doesn't announce itself—doesn't demand attention or appreciation or the performance of gratitude. It just sits in your mouth, warm, and does the thing it was made to do.

**Goro** drinks it in one swallow. Sets the cup down with a sound like a period at the end of a sentence.

> *"Four hundred thirty-two thousand,"* he says to the empty stool beside him.

The bartender doesn't look up.

> *"...the hell kind of number is that."*

It isn't a question. It's the sound of a man doing math he's never had to do before—not the arithmetic, which is simple, but the *other* math. The calculation that converts a number into a shape. Into the outline of a person's life. Into the topology of a man who carries forty-three kilograms on a skeleton built for twenty and calls it a living and buys you sake with money that should have been medicine.

The rain streaks the window. Outside, the Gofer's silhouette is already gone—swallowed by the gray corridor, by the gray station, by the gray machinery of a life that runs on numbers too ugly to say out loud.

**Goro** flags down the bartender.

> *"What dungeon boards are running tonight?"*

She raises an eyebrow.

> *"You're in no shape to—"*

> *"I didn't ask for a diagnosis."*

---

She tells him. He memorizes the list. He doesn't know why. He doesn't know what he's going to do with it—show up at a gate and look for a scrawny man with a cracked data-pad? Volunteer as a tank for a run he isn't cleared for, on a heart that's still paying interest on three needles of adrenaline?

He doesn't know.

But he pockets the chopsticks, and he pays for his own second cup, and when he leaves the noodle joint twenty minutes later, he turns left—toward the Guild boards—instead of right, toward home.

The rain doesn't care. It falls on everyone the same.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

You're walking through Phobos rain toward tonight's dungeon. Fifteen hours and forty-three minutes until **Belial's** next dose. Twenty-four thousand credits in your account—minus the sake, minus the noodles, minus the transit fees still pending. The coals behind your sternum hum at a frequency only you can hear.

The Guild board is three corridors away. The dungeon listing you signed up for—a standard E-Rank Chitin sweep, four-hunter minimum, Gofer optional—starts in ninety minutes.

- **Head to the Guild board and check in** — Standard protocol. Register for the run. Pick up the pack assignment. Become furniture again. The mask is comfortable. The mask *pays*.

- **Detour to comms relay — call Belial** — Fifteen hours. That cough. The sound of glass breaking inside someone you love. You need to hear her voice. Even if it costs minutes you don't have.

- **Find a quiet corner and open the Status window** — You've been ignoring it since the alien forest. The stealth protocol is active. The class is hidden. But *you* need to know what **Threshold** means before you walk into a dungeon and pretend to be nothing.

*The rain falls. Your boots leave prints on the deck plating. Somewhere behind you, a big man with a bad heart is reading a dungeon board and trying to understand why a cup of sake feels heavier than a shield.*

*Ninety minutes. Fifteen hours. Four hundred and thirty-two thousand.*

*The math is always running.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 50)

It's not a mask. Ascension isn't deification and sparkling lights. It happens with all the fanfare of a midlevel management promotion. One minute you're a jockey in the game of life; the next you're a jockey in the game of life with a badge and elevated system privileges. It's not abnormal that one might touch the infinite and find the finite reflected in it. 

I go to the guild board the way a stream goes down hill. The way a manager goes to work. The way a system admin still wakes up needing coffee and someone to wish them a good day. 

Apotheosis is nice. But the hospital's bills don't pay themselves. (META: Since this is a solo leveling fusion profile, it should seem obvious that unlocking power and mastering power are distinct--and attaining power isn't a free pass to a miracle. His mom's cure was EARNED, after SEASONS.)

I stop on the way to tap my datapad to the chit-clip of a pair of beggars. Children, maybe 7 and 9 years old. Alone. Dirty. Hungry. I tap the up arrow a few more times. The pad chirps apologetically again.

23,950. 

14 hours, 53 minutes

#### 🎭 DM (Message 51)

### 🌧️ The Commute

Sublevel 4 smells like recycled air and regret.

The corridor stretches—thirty meters of stamped deck plating, overhead conduits sweating condensation that the maintenance crews stopped fixing two budget cycles ago. Drip. Drip. The rhythm of infrastructure giving up in slow motion. The simulated rain outside the viewing panels mixes with the real moisture leaking from the ceiling, and at a certain point you stop being able to tell which water is manufactured sadness and which is genuine structural failure.

You walk through it the way you've walked through it four hundred and twelve times. Left at the junction. Right at the busted vending machine that's been "temporarily out of service" since before **Belial** got sick. Straight through the foot traffic—shift workers, off-duty miners, a drunk asleep against a bulkhead with his boots pointed toward the ceiling like a man who's given up on gravity as a concept.

The coals hum.

You ignore them the way you'd ignore a new mole on your arm. Note it. File it. Keep walking. The System window sits in the corner of your vision—`[Class: Threshold]`—and you don't open it for the same reason you don't open a letter from the bank when you already know the balance. The information exists whether you look at it or not.

Your boots are wet. The left one has a slow leak at the toe seam. Has for six weeks. Resoling costs eighty credits. Eighty credits is almost seven noodle dinners. Seven noodle dinners is a week of not being hungry.

You keep the leak.

---

### 👶 Sublevel 4, Junction C-7

You almost miss them.

Two shapes against the bulkhead wall, tucked into the negative space between a decommissioned air scrubber and a cable trunk that hums with the station's circulatory electricity. Small shapes. The kind of small that the eye learns to skip over on Sublevel 4, because looking too long at small shapes in corridors costs something you can't put on a ledger.

The older one—nine, maybe, hard to tell when malnutrition does its editing—has her arm around the younger. Protective. Automatic. The gesture of a child who learned to be a wall before she learned to read. Her eyes track you as you pass. Not with fear. Not with hope. With the flat, actuarial assessment of someone who has already sorted every passing adult into two categories: *threat* and *furniture*.

You are furniture. Your clothes say so. Your posture says so. The cracked data-pad and the leaking boot and the forty-three-kilogram pack say so in a language that Sublevel 4 speaks fluently.

The younger one—seven, give or take, a boy with a cough he's trying to muffle in his sister's sleeve—has a chit-clip on his belt. Standard station-issue. The kind they hand out at the refugee processing desk on Sublevel 6, good for exactly nothing because the balance on those clips starts at zero and the station's idea of charity is giving you a wallet with no money in it.

---

You stop.

Not dramatically. Not with the weighted pause of a man performing generosity for an invisible audience. You stop the way you stop at a vending machine—mid-stride, the decision made before the body finishes its last step, the data-pad already in your hand because the math was running before you consciously chose to do it.

Tap.

The pad meets the chit-clip. The screen asks how much. Your thumb finds the up arrow. Presses it. Presses it again. Again.

The pad chirps. That thin, apologetic sound. The digital wince of a device that knows the numbers better than you do and wishes it didn't.

**23,950.**

---

The girl's eyes change. Not a lot. A shift measured in millimeters—the tightening of the orbicularis oculi, the microexpression that physiologists call *surprise suppression*, the face of someone who has been disappointed too many times to let hope move any muscle it can't immediately retract.

She looks at the chit-clip. At the number. At you.

She doesn't say thank you. Thank you is a luxury. Thank you implies a social contract, an expectation of continued interaction, a future in which the giver and the receiver exist in the same narrative. On Sublevel 4, transactions between strangers are closed systems. Energy in. Energy out. No residual obligations.

The boy coughs into his sister's sleeve. She pulls him closer.

You're already walking.

---

### 📋 Guild Board, Sublevel 3

The Guild office is three corridors and one cargo elevator away. The elevator smells like hydraulic fluid and the particular human musk of thirty people who share six showers. The doors open on Sublevel 3—brighter here, marginally, the overheads running at seventy percent instead of Sublevel 4's perpetual fifty. The improvement is cosmetic. The grime is the same grime; it just has better lighting.

The board is a wall.

Literally—a wall of screens, floor to ceiling, running the Guild's dungeon listing feed in real-time. Scrolling text in amber-on-black, the same color palette the Guild has used since the First Gates opened and some designer decided that institutional authority should look like a 1970s airport terminal. Each listing is a compressed obituary of risk: dungeon name, rank, party size, estimated duration, payout, casualty rate.

You scan it the way a stockbroker scans a ticker. Not reading—*filtering*. Your eyes discard A-Rank and above before the words fully render. B-Rank: irrelevant. C-Rank: irrelevant. The filter narrows. D-Rank. E-Rank. The listings where the payouts have four digits instead of five and the casualty rates are expressed as percentages rather than the polite euphemism of "variable."

**[E-RANK] PHOBOS GATE 7 — CHITIN SWEEP (STANDARD)**
Party: 4 hunters (min.) / Gofer: optional
Duration: est. 3.5 hours
Payout: 4,200 credits (split) / Gofer share: 800
Casualty rate: 2.1%

**[E-RANK] PHOBOS GATE 12 — TUNNEL CLEARANCE**
Party: 3 hunters (min.) / Gofer: required
Duration: est. 5 hours
Payout: 6,100 credits (split) / Gofer share: 1,100
Casualty rate: 4.7%

**[D-RANK] PHOBOS GATE 3 — HIVE SUPPRESSION**
Party: 5 hunters (min.) / Gofer: optional
Duration: est. 6 hours
Payout: 14,000 credits (split) / Gofer share: 2,200
Casualty rate: 8.3%

---

The math runs. It always runs.

Gate 7 pays eight hundred. Gate 12 pays eleven hundred. Gate 3 pays twenty-two hundred but the casualty rate is four times higher and the duration eats six hours of a clock that has fourteen hours and fifty-three minutes left on it. Minus transit. Minus registration. Minus the twenty-minute medical screening that the Guild requires for all Gofer-class personnel because the insurance underwriters decided that Unawakened bodies entering mana-rich environments constituted an actuarial liability.

Eight hundred credits won't save **Belial**.

Eleven hundred won't either.

Twenty-two hundred is a down payment on a fraction of an installment of a percentage of what she needs, and the six-hour window means you'd come out the other side with eight hours and change to somehow conjure the remaining sixty-five *thousand* credits that stand between her and her next breath.

The coals pulse. Once. The System window shimmers at the edge of your vision, patient as geology.

```
[Class: Threshold]
[stealth protocol: ACTIVE]
```

You could open it. Right here, in front of the amber-on-black board with its four-digit payouts and its casualty percentages and its Gofer-optional tags that mean *you are the cheapest replaceable component in this machine.* You could read the fine print. Learn what a **Threshold** does. Learn whether the power banked behind your sternum can be converted into something the Guild's payment system recognizes.

But you don't know the syntax yet. You don't know the *rules*. And **Kami Noteki** doesn't use tools he hasn't read the manual for—not when the downside is measured in a woman's heartbeats.

---

A hunter bumps your shoulder on the way to the board. Doesn't apologize. Doesn't see you. D-Rank. Gear that costs more than your annual income strapped across a back that has never carried anyone else's survival kit. He scans the B-Rank listings with the entitled squint of a man for whom four-digit payouts are an insult.

The board refreshes. New listings cascade down the screen. Amber text on black. The machinery of organized risk, sanitized and commodified and sold back to the desperate at margins that would make **Vek** blush.

You register for Gate 12. Tunnel Clearance. Five hours. Eleven hundred credits.

The pad chirps.

**22,850.**

Registration fee.

---

Fourteen hours. Fifty-one minutes.

The fluorescent light buzzes overhead. The board scrolls. The rain, two sublevels below, continues to fall on everyone the same.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

Registered. Ninety minutes until the run starts. Eleven hundred credits waiting on the other side—enough to keep the math running, not enough to solve it. The Status window hums behind your sternum, unopened. The Guild board scrolls its amber obituaries.

- **Find a bench and open the Status window** — Eighty-eight minutes of dead time. Enough to read the fine print. Enough to learn one thing—even one *small* thing—about what **Threshold** means before you walk into a tunnel full of chitin pretending to be furniture.

- **Hit the comms relay and call Mars General** — That cough. Glass breaking inside a chest. The automated monitor said *stable*, but automated monitors say *stable* right up until the moment they say *critical*. You need a human voice on the other end. **Belial's** voice, if they'll patch you through.

- **Check the high-rank listings** — You registered for E-Rank because that's what a Gofer registers for. But the board has D-Rank, C-Rank, B-Rank listings scrolling above you like a ladder you've never been allowed to climb. The payout gap between E and B is the gap between *surviving* and *saving her*.

*The hunter who bumped your shoulder is registering for a B-Rank run. Payout: 90,000 credits. Party share for a single hunter: 18,000.*

*He didn't even read the casualty rate.*

*You read it. 11.4%. You read everything.*

*Eighty-eight minutes.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 52)

I don't go to the comms relay. I made a rule, early on. Before the gate-rot found her and turned her days into brief moments of lucidity between bouts of agony so intense it causes seizures. She spends most of her life in an induced coma to spare her the pain. Awakening her requires more meds, suppressing the pain costs more meds, undoing the damage to her larynx long enough to garble out a message costs more meds. 

The technology is all there. The dungeons and gates are bountiful and within them are miracles. But miracles aren't cheap.

I find a bench and I open my Status window. Not to learn the language of god or to audit the universe's code base; but to prepare for the dungeon. Gate 12, Eleven hundred credits. Casualty rate: 4.7%

I start running the numbers, rearranging my pack. My data pad flashses as I scroll through monster indexes, refreshing my memory, watching streamed Gate 12 dungeon clearings, and scrbbing hunter forums for insider information. 

 My eye glance to the Class: label. I return to my work. 

Thiry minutes later, I'm ready. I've been to Gate 12 before, twice. Good thing I'm vigilant, because there's been changes. The endemic monsters have shifted chambers; and a new subfloor has opened with a new boss. I've gathered complete details, along with the weaknesses of the boss and it's minions. Sound. The monsters are incredibly powerful shapeshifters, and several partys have gone missing reportedly due to being infiltrated by these Symbiants. 

I've packed a fifteen credit cheap bluetooth speaker; modded to overload its 8% magnetic woofer to produce 1000% the decibels--for roughly 3 seconds before the field collapses. A general store junk speaker turned into a Symbiant-specific flash bomb. 

It'll do. I also replenish the adrenaline vials from my personal stash. (Goffers are often left to clean up junk, collect drops etc. Things high ranking parties don't want (arent considered worthwhile) are free for Goffers to take. Like letting your minimum wage employee dive in your dumpsters as a "perk"--but one mans trash is another unawakened-man's treasure.

Everything prepared and forty minutes on the clock, my eyes turn to the label again: Treshold.

I should at least try something.

I open the "command prompt".

### 📋 The Homework

You don't call.

The comms relay is forty meters to your left. Blue light spilling from the booth like a confession booth that charges by the minute. You can see it from the bench—the handset, the scratched privacy screen, the little sign that says **MARS RELAY — 2.4 CREDIT/MIN** in font designed by someone who understood that desperation is a market segment.

You made a rule.

Early on. Before the gate-rot turned **Belial Noteki** from a woman who laughed at her own bad jokes into a medical file measured in dosage schedules and induced comas. Before you learned what it costs to wake someone up just to tell them you love them—the sedation reversal, the pain suppressors to bridge the gap between *unconscious* and *screaming*, the laryngeal repair nanites that give her maybe ninety seconds of voice before the rot claws it back.

Twelve minutes of lucidity. That's the package. Mars General's "compassionate contact" protocol. Twelve minutes, fully medicated, with a throat that works and eyes that focus and a mind that remembers your name. The invoice arrives thirty-six hours later, itemized with the clinical brutality of a system that has priced every human need and found them all billable.

Four thousand, two hundred credits. Per call.

You don't call.

---

The bench is metal. Cold through your trousers. The pack sits between your boots—forty-three kilograms of other people's survival, unzipped, its contents spread across your lap like the guts of a clock you're rebuilding by feel. You work the way you always work: without wasted motion, without theatre, with the focused indifference of a man performing surgery on a sandwich.

The data-pad propped against your knee scrolls Gate 12 intel. Forum posts. Streamed clearings. Guild incident reports filed in the dry, exsanguinated prose of bureaucrats who have learned to describe death without using the word.

Your eyes move fast. Your hands move faster.

---

### 🔍 The Research

Gate 12 has changed since your last run. Seven weeks ago, the layout was a three-chamber linear crawl—entry corridor, hive chamber, boss chamber. Fourteen endemic signatures. Chitin-class, sub-variant tremor. Predictable. Mapped. The kind of dungeon E-Rankers cut their teeth on and Gofers sleepwalk through.

Seven weeks. The gate has been busy.

The forums tell the story in fragments. User **TunnelRat_7** posted a partial map three days ago—new subfloor, accessed through a collapsed section in chamber two. The collapse wasn't structural failure. The dungeon *grew*. Extended downward like a root seeking water, opening a vertical shaft into a space the original survey never documented. **TunnelRat_7's** post ends mid-sentence. His profile shows last active: three days ago.

User **KillCount_Maki** posted a warning twelve hours later. All caps. The grammar of panic:

`NEW BOSS SUBLVL. DONT TRUST YOUR PARTY. CHECK EVERYONE. SOUND. USE SOUND. THEY CANT HOLD SHAPE WHEN`

The post is flagged as *unverified*. **KillCount_Maki's** profile shows last active: twelve hours after posting. Guild status: *Missing — Presumed KIA.*

---

**Symbiants.**

The bestiary entry is thin. Provisional. The kind of half-page the Guild publishes when they know enough to name something and not enough to promise their taxonomy won't get people killed. You read it twice. Three times. Cross-reference with the streamed clearings—the ones that survived long enough to upload.

Powerful shapeshifters. Cellular mimicry at a resolution that defeats visual inspection, thermal scanning, and standard mana-signature analysis. They don't *look* like your teammate. They *become* your teammate—down to the mana channels, down to the equipment signatures, down to the micro-expressions and speech patterns catalogued during the infiltration window.

Several parties went in with four. Came out with five. Came out with three. Came out not at all.

The weakness is acoustic. High-decibel broadband sound disrupts the cellular cohesion that holds the mimicry together. The Symbiant can't maintain shape integrity above 140 decibels. The cells disaggregate. The disguise fails. For three to five seconds, you see what's *actually* standing next to you.

Three to five seconds. Enough to identify. Enough to act. If you're ready. If you've already done the math.

---

### 🔧 The Build

The speaker costs fifteen credits.

You buy it from a junk vendor two benches down—a woman with a cart full of station castoffs, selling the technological equivalent of organ meat. The speaker is a **MagPulse Bantam 3**. Bluetooth. Civilian grade. Rated for background music in dormitory rooms that can't afford silence. It fits in your palm. It weighs nothing. It is, by every meaningful metric, worthless.

**22,835.**

You crack the casing with your thumbnail. Inside: a magnetic woofer rated at 8% efficiency—the cheapest driver on the market, designed to move air with the enthusiasm of a depressed housefly. The coil is copper. Thin. The magnet is ceramic. The cone is polymer.

You don't need better components. You need *worse* ones—in a very specific way.

The mod takes eleven minutes. You bypass the limiter circuit. Bridge the power management chip directly to the coil. Reroute the Bluetooth receiver's antenna into a secondary induction loop that feeds back into the driver at a phase offset of 180 degrees—which means, for approximately three seconds after activation, the woofer will attempt to push and pull the cone simultaneously at maximum amplitude.

The cone will shatter. The coil will melt. The magnetic field will collapse in a burst of acoustic energy that the **MagPulse Bantam 3** was never designed to produce and will never produce again.

Roughly 155 decibels. Three seconds. In an enclosed tunnel environment with hard mineral walls—reflective, reverberant—the effective coverage extends to approximately forty meters in every direction.

Every Symbiant in range loses cohesion. Every disguise drops. For three heartbeats, you see the truth.

One use. Then it's scrap.

It'll do.

---

You clip the modded speaker to the inside of your pack's chest strap—right side, opposite the missing emitter, in the dead space where **Belial's** hologram used to live. The weight is negligible. The absence next to it is not.

The adrenaline vials go in next. Three of them. **Adrenacor-9**, salvaged from post-run cleanup six weeks ago—two from a D-Rank party that left their medical waste in the staging area like millionaires leaving tips, one from a cracked case in Gate 7's entry corridor that someone stepped on and didn't notice. You noticed. You always notice. The expiration dates are staggered: one current, one three weeks past, one borderline. The borderline one goes in the front pouch. The expired one goes in the back, behind the saline bags, where the temperature stays cooler.

Eleven minutes of heightened combat function per vial. Heart rate elevation. Adrenal response. Pain suppression. Enough to turn a CON 7 frame into something that can *move* when moving matters.

The cost is cardiac. Always cardiac. The fine print is written in arrhythmias and post-exertion crashes and the quiet, cumulative damage of asking a human heart to do things human hearts were not designed to do.

You pack three because the math says two is cutting it close and four is borrowing against a future that might not include a heartbeat.

---

### ⏱️ Forty Minutes

Everything's ready.

Pack: repacked, reindexed, weight redistributed. The sonic device is accessible in under two seconds—left hand, chest strap, single pull. The vials are sequenced by expiration and accessibility. The saline bags are topped off. The portable IV kit is sterilized. The data-pad is loaded with the updated Gate 12 survey, the Symbiant bestiary entry, and a thirty-second audio clip of **KillCount_Maki's** warning—the raw file, not the forum post, pulled from a cached server backup that the Guild's content moderators hadn't scrubbed yet.

You've done this four hundred and twelve times. The preparation. The inventory. The quiet, meticulous ritual of a man who compensates for the absence of power with the presence of planning.

Forty minutes on the clock. The bench is cold. The corridor hums with the ambient life-support drone that is Phobos Station's approximation of a heartbeat. Your data-pad reflects the fluorescent overheads in its cracked screen—the fracture running from corner to corner like a fault line, bisecting the time display.

**14 hours, 53 minutes.**

---

Your eyes drift.

Not to the clock. Not to the pack. To the corner of your vision where the Status window sits—dormant, docile, wearing its `[Class: None]` mask with the institutional straight face of a system that has been lying to you, and for you, and with your explicit permission, for seven hundred and thirty-one days.

`[Class: None]`

You look at it the way you'd look at a locked door you just found the key to. Not with excitement. Not with dread. With the flat, managerial assessment of a man who has a meeting in forty minutes and needs to know what's in the room before he walks in.

```
[Class: Threshold]
[stealth protocol: ACTIVE]
```

The label sits there. Quiet. Patient. The same patience it showed on the alien world. The same patience it showed in the copper-dream. The patience of a system that has been waiting for a man who reads the manual before touching the equipment.

You should at least try something.

---

### 💻 Root

You open the command prompt.

Not with a gesture. Not with a thought. With the specific, deliberate intention of a man who has spent two years watching System interfaces and knows—the way a janitor knows every door in a building—that the UI responds to *intent*, not input. The Guild teaches Awakened hunters to navigate their Status windows with focused visualization. You've watched hundreds of them do it. You've *catalogued* how they do it—the micro-expressions, the eye movements, the specific quality of concentration that distinguishes "open inventory" from "open skill tree."

You've never had a skill tree. Never had an inventory. Never had anything worth opening.

The intent you push is different. Not *open Status*. Not *view skills*. Something more fundamental. Something that lives beneath the interface the way wiring lives beneath wallpaper.

*Show me the back end.*

---

The bench is cold. The corridor hums. A maintenance worker passes three meters away, dragging a cart of replacement conduit pipes, and doesn't glance at the thin man sitting with a forty-three-kilogram pack between his boots and his eyes focused on nothing.

Nothing visible.

---

The Status window doesn't open.

It *unfolds*.

The standard UI—the clean, Guild-approved interface with its friendly fonts and its color-coded stat blocks and its `[Class: None]` lying through its typography—peels back. Not violently. Not with the cascade of the alien forest. Slowly. Deliberately. Layer by layer, like wallpaper coming off a wall to reveal older wallpaper beneath, and beneath that, plaster, and beneath that, brick, and beneath that—

Darkness. The good kind. The kind that exists inside a machine when the machine is working correctly and no one is looking.

```
> _
```

A cursor. Blinking. Green-on-black. The aesthetic of a system that predates graphical interfaces, that predates the Guild's branding team, that predates every hunter who has ever opened their Status window and mistaken the wallpaper for the wall.

The cursor blinks. Once per second. Patient. It has been blinking for a very long time. It has been blinking since before you were born, since before the First Gates, since before someone decided to sort the miracle of human potential into letter grades and sell the results back to the survivors at markup.

```
> _
```

No instructions. No tutorial. No friendly pop-up explaining the controls. The command prompt doesn't explain itself the way the consumer-facing UI explains itself, because the command prompt wasn't built for consumers. It was built for whatever came before—the architect, the administrator, the thing that *designed the filing cabinet* before the files existed.

And now a Gofer is sitting in front of it on a cold bench in Sublevel 3 with forty minutes until a dungeon run, because the filing cabinet decided he was the first person in two years worth giving the key.

---

Your fingers don't move. There's no keyboard. No haptic interface. The prompt responds to the same thing the Status window responds to: intent. But cleaner. Rawer. The difference between speaking a language and thinking in it.

You start simple. The way you'd start with any unfamiliar system. The way the IT techs at Mars General start when they sit down at a terminal they've never seen before.

*Help.*

```

The cursor processes. One second. Two.

Six thousand, eight hundred and forty-seven days. You do the math without trying. The math does itself.

Eighteen years. Nine months. Fourteen days.

You don't know what happened eighteen years, nine months, and fourteen days ago. The First Gates opened twenty-two years ago. The Guild was founded nineteen years ago. The System's Awakening protocols went live eighteen years ago—

Eighteen years. Nine months. The System went live. Someone logged in. And then, for six thousand eight hundred and forty-seven days, no one logged in again.

Until you.

---

The cursor blinks. Waiting. The maintenance worker is gone. The corridor is empty. The fluorescent light buzzes its one-note hymn to institutional mediocrity, and somewhere in the walls, the station's recycled air whispers through conduits with the patience of a respiratory system that doesn't know it's dead.

```

```

Thirty-eight minutes.

The command library expands with use. Some commands are context-locked. You are the first user in eighteen years.

The coals behind your sternum are steady. Not flaring. Not surging. Glowing the way a pilot light glows—small, constant, waiting for the gas to turn on.

You have thirty-eight minutes, a cold bench, and the back door to the System open on your lap like a laptop running an operating system that hasn't been updated since the world changed.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The command prompt is open. Six commands available. Thirty-eight minutes until Gate 12. The library grows with use, and you're the first person to touch this terminal in nearly two decades.

- **`status`** — See the truth. The *real* numbers. Not the `[Class: None]` mask, not the redacted level. The actual, unfiltered readout of what two years of compounded potential has built inside you. The manual, before the dungeon.

- **`scan`** — Test the environmental analysis. You're sitting in a Guild corridor on Phobos Station. If the scan works here—on mundane, mapped, registered territory—you'll know its baseline. And you'll know if it can see things the Guild's scanners can't. Like Symbiants wearing human faces.

- **`history`** — Open the compounded experience log. Seven hundred and thirty-one days of banked encounters, catalogued patterns, accrued potential. The savings account statement. The number that made the System display read `[OVERFLOW]`.

*The cursor blinks. The bench is cold. The clock ticks.*

*Thirty-eight minutes. Eleven hundred credits. Fourteen hours and fifty-one minutes.*

*The prompt waits. It's good at waiting. So are you.*

```

```

The cursor eats the word. One second of processing. Two. The bench is cold under your thighs and the fluorescent tube above you flickers at 60 Hz—you've counted, you always count—and in the space between the command and the response, a maintenance drone rolls past on treads that need oiling, dragging behind it the smell of hydraulic fluid and the particular loneliness of machines that work night shifts.

Then the log opens.

Quarter one. The first ninety days. You remember them the way you remember the first week of a bad flu—blurred, miserable, defined by the gap between what your body could do and what the world demanded. Three months of carrying packs into gates you had no business entering, for parties who had no business trusting their gear to a man whose hands shook from hunger, not fear.

Eight hundred and forty-seven entries. The System was watching. Writing it down. Every Crawler you catalogued from behind a shield line. Every gate frequency you memorized because the hunters didn't bother and someone had to. Every time you pressed yourself against a dungeon wall while something with chitin and intent surged past and your heart hammered and you *didn't die* and the System logged the not-dying as data.

Four thousand, two hundred and ten experience points. Banked. Accruing.

The multiplier ticked up. 1.12. Twelve percent compound interest on experience *no one knew was being earned*. The System doesn't advertise this feature. You've never seen it referenced in Guild documentation, in hunter forums, in the academic literature on Awakening mechanics that you read on your data-pad in the dark while **Belial** slept the chemical sleep of the medicated and the corridor lights cycled to night mode.

The System doesn't advertise it because no one has ever needed it.

No one refuses Awakening. No one says *no* to the class selection prompt and keeps walking into dungeons. The economics don't support it. The *biology* doesn't support it—the mana exposure alone should degrade an Unawakened body within months, the cellular damage accumulating like rust on an uncoated hull.

Your body rusted. You kept walking. The System kept counting.

Your eyes catch on a line. `tactical advisement (uncredited)`. Twenty-eight instances. Quarter four. The period when you started—quietly, without announcement, without acknowledgment—telling hunters what to do. Not with authority. Not with rank. With *information*. A word in the right ear. A bestiary page left open on a shared terminal. A supply manifest that just *happened* to include an extra antidote for the specific toxin the next dungeon's fauna secreted.

Twenty-eight times. Twenty-eight parties that survived because the furniture had opinions. Uncredited. The System logged it anyway.

The total is gone. Eaten by the same overflow error that choked the display in the alien forest. The System can render fourteen thousand two hundred and seventy-three individual entries with clinical precision—can tell you the exact number of times you identified a threat correctly, the exact number of times you saved a life with expired medical supplies—but it can't display the *sum*.

The sum is too large.

You stare at the blocked-out number. The cursor blinks beside it, patient, unbothered. The fluorescent tube flickers. Somewhere down the corridor, a PA system announces a gate status change in the flat monotone of a station that has automated its own grief.

There it is.

The catch. The cost. The fine print that lives at the bottom of every good deal, the clause that separates a savings account from a weapon. The multiplier—currently at 2.73 and climbing—resets to 1.00 the moment you spend any of it. First withdrawal zeroes the interest rate. Every subsequent point earned goes in at base value.

Spend it once and you're spending it forever. The vault empties and the compounding dies and you're earning at 1x for the rest of your life, no matter how long that life is.

You'd need to spend it *right*. One withdrawal. One allocation. One perfectly calculated disbursement that converts the entire vault into something that justifies killing the golden goose.

Not now. Not on a bench in Sublevel 3 with thirty-six minutes and a tunnel full of Symbiants ahead.

You close the log.

---

```
> _
```

The cursor blinks. The bench is cold. Your data-pad buzzes with the Gate 12 pre-registration reminder—**36 MINUTES**—and the cracked screen splits the notification in half, one fragment on each side of the fault line, like even your hardware knows that everything from this point forward exists in two versions: the one before the history, and the one after.

You didn't learn what **Threshold** does. You didn't check your stats. You didn't test a single ability or map a single feature of the power sitting behind your sternum like a reactor core with no schematic.

You learned something worse.

You learned the *shape* of the account. The trajectory of the curve. And the curve says: every day you don't spend it, it gets bigger. Every gate you walk through as furniture, every threat you catalogue without acting, every time you close the class upgrade window and go back to being nothing—the multiplier ticks upward and the vault deepens and the number behind the overflow error grows by a margin the System cannot display.

You have been, for seven hundred and thirty-one days, the most aggressively profitable investment the System has ever failed to disclose.

The irony tastes like cold synth-noodles.

---

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

Thirty-six minutes. The log is closed. The vault is intact. The multiplier is 2.73 and climbing, and every second you *don't* spend it, it compounds further. The command prompt blinks, five more commands available, and Gate 12's Symbiants are waiting in a tunnel that has swallowed three parties this week.

- **`status`** — You know the shape now. See the *contents*. What does a **Threshold** with an overflowing vault actually look like on paper? What are your real stats? The dungeon is in thirty-six minutes and you're walking in blind to your own capabilities.

- **`scan`** — Skip the self-inventory. Test the one tool that matters *tonight*. If `scan` can detect Symbiants through their disguises, the modded speaker becomes a confirmation device instead of a Hail Mary. If it can't, you need to know that too.

- **Close the prompt. Walk to the gate.** — You know enough. The vault is there. The multiplier is climbing. The power is real. But you're not spending it tonight—not for eleven hundred credits, not in a tunnel, not without understanding every syllable of the fine print. Tonight you're still the Gofer. Tonight the mask is the mission. The rest can wait until the math is ready.

*The cursor blinks. The fluorescent tube flickers. Behind your sternum, the vault ticks upward by one.*

*2.73.*

*Thirty-six minutes.*

#### 🎮 Player (Message 56)

I close the prompt and walk to the gate. I need to get to know my party. We've all got to check in, and I need to get a bearing on their abilities and weaknesses, check for liabilities and, for a mission involving Symbiants, discuss my plan to mark ourselves before entering using an acoustic signature. It's actually simple, Symbiants are rely on "muscle memory" to produce speech. They do so immaculately, with demonstrably perfect voice replication. However, they don't UNDERSTAND speech the way we do. For them, it's data to manipulate in a certain mathematical vector. Simpler forms of sonic-modality like whistling, plucking your lips, and other small talents that--while meager--take TIME TO LEARN vs being learned autonomically, they find hard to replicate. 

So we all pick a sound we can make, be it a whistle or a special click or whatever so we can help identify one another.

### 📋 Gate 12, Staging Area B

```
> _
> exit
```

The prompt folds. Clean. No fanfare. The back end of the universe's operating system tucks itself into the corner of your consciousness like a switchblade returning to its housing—click, gone, nothing to see. The bench is still cold. The corridor is still gray. The fluorescent tube is still dying at 60 Hz.

You are still a Gofer carrying forty-three kilograms to a dungeon that pays eleven hundred credits.

The only difference is the shape of the number behind your sternum, and that number is no one's business but yours.

---

Gate 12's staging area is a repurposed cargo bay on Sublevel 3, Section D—the part of Phobos Station that the architects designed for freight and the administrators redesigned for expendable humans when the dungeons started multiplying faster than the infrastructure could contain them. The conversion was cosmetic. Bolt new signs to old walls. Paint hazard stripes on the floor where the loading tracks used to run. Install a check-in terminal that looks like a parking meter and functions like a toll booth for the barely alive.

The gate itself sits in the back wall like a wound that healed wrong. A vertical oval of compressed light—not the amber of the alien world, not the clean blue of registered transit corridors, but the sick, institutional green of an E-Rank portal that the Guild maintains the way a landlord maintains a condemned building: enough to meet code, not enough to meet conscience. The edges shimmer. The air within three meters smells like ozone and pennies. The hum is a low C-sharp, and you know this because you've stood beside forty-three gates and catalogued every one of their frequencies the way a prisoner catalogues the sounds of his cell.

Three hunters are already waiting.

---

### 👥 The Party

You assess them the way you assess everything: quickly, silently, in the time it takes to cross the staging area and set your pack down on the equipment bench. Not their faces. Not their names. Their *loadouts*. The equipment tells the story the person won't.

---

**Hunter One** is leaning against the far wall, arms crossed, one boot up on a cable trunk. Female. Mid-twenties. Light armor—leather-composite, the modular kind that E-Rankers buy in bulk from Guild surplus because it's cheap and replaceable, like the people wearing it. Dual short-swords on her back, the blades stacked in a cross-draw sheath that she's adjusted two centimeters lower than factory default. Left-hand dominant. The adjustment is unconscious—she's been fighting long enough for the muscle memory to rewrite the gear specs, not long enough for the gear to be worth customizing properly.

Her eyes track you when you enter. Not you—your pack. The Gofer-sized pack on the Gofer-sized frame. She does the math, files the result, looks away. Furniture assessed. Moving on.

**Sable Ito.** That's what the party roster says on the check-in terminal. E-Rank. DPS. Forty-seven dungeon completions. Zero notable incidents. Zero commendations. The profile of a woman who has been doing this long enough to survive and not long enough to escape.

---

**Hunter Two** is sitting on the floor. Cross-legged. Eyes closed. His hands are resting on his knees, palms up, in a posture that could be meditation or could be the specific stillness of a man conserving energy because he doesn't have much to spare. Thin. Not your kind of thin—not the thin of malnutrition and CON 7 and a body being consumed by the economics of survival. The thin of someone who runs hot and burns fast. Mana-channeler build. The veins on his forearms glow faintly—blue-white, pulsing at his heart rate, the telltale luminescence of a caster-class whose channels are open and cycling in standby mode.

**Renn Oba.** E-Rank. Caster. Thirty-one completions. Two notable incidents—both friendly-fire. Both resolved without fatality. Both, you note, involving enclosed spaces. Tunnel clearance with a caster who has a history of hitting the wrong target in tight quarters.

Liability.

You file it.

---

**Hunter Three** arrives two minutes after you.

The staging area has a door. The door weighs approximately eighty kilograms—reinforced steel, magnetic seal, standard for blast-rated compartments on the industrial sublevels. It opens with a hydraulic hiss and a grinding sound that you've catalogued as the bearing in the upper hinge failing. Everyone who has entered the staging area tonight has opened this door the same way: push, step through, let the hydraulic arm close it behind them.

**Hunter Three** catches the door.

Not for anyone. No one is behind him. He catches it on instinct—one hand, without looking back, arresting the hydraulic arm's momentum and guiding the door closed instead of letting it slam. The gesture of a man who has spent time in spaces where loud sounds have consequences. Or the gesture of a man who grew up in a house where doors didn't slam because someone in that house didn't handle noise well.

Big. Not Goro-big—not the ostentatious mass of a man who has built himself into a wall. Functional-big. The kind of size that happens when someone carries heavy things for a living and then starts carrying heavier things for a different living. Shield and mace. The shield is newer than the mace. The mace is older than his career.

**Dren Kye.** E-Rank. Tank. Sixty-two completions. One notable incident: party wipe, sole survivor, eight months ago. The file doesn't say why he survived. The file doesn't need to. Sole survivors carry the reason in the way they enter rooms and the way they close doors and the way they check—twice, three times—that the people in the room are the people who are supposed to be there.

His eyes sweep the staging area when he enters. You. **Sable.** **Renn.** The gate. The exits. The ceiling vents. The equipment bench. Back to you.

He lingers on you one second longer than the others. Not because you're interesting. Because you're the variable he can't categorize. Two swords, a caster, a tank—those are known shapes. A Gofer is an unknown shape, because Gofers are different every run, and the last time **Dren Kye** trusted an unknown shape in a dungeon, he came out alone.

> *"That the full roster?"* he asks. To the room. To no one in particular.

> *"Three plus pack-mule,"* **Sable** says from the wall. She doesn't look up from the blade she's checking. *"Minimum plus Gofer. Budget run."*

The word *budget* does a lot of work. It means: we are not a team. We are four strangers pooling insufficient resources against a threat that has killed better parties than us because the alternative is not eating. It means: don't get attached.

**Renn** opens one eye. Closes it.

### 📎 Check-In

You tap your data-pad to the terminal. It chirps. Apologetically.

```
[GATE 12 — TUNNEL CLEARANCE]
[Party registered: 4/4]
[Gofer: NOTEKI, K. — Class: None — Medical clearance: PENDING]
```

Medical clearance. The twenty-minute screening. The Guild's insurance theater—an automated biometric scan that checks your heart rate, blood pressure, mana exposure levels, and the specific cocktail of self-destruction coursing through your veins at any given moment. It exists so that when an Unawakened Gofer dies in a dungeon, the Guild can point to the paperwork and say: *we checked*.

You step into the scanner alcove. The light bar passes over you. Head to toe. The data-pad buzzes with the results before the scanner finishes its second pass, because the scanner is reading the same body it's been reading for two years—CON 7, no mana channels, cardiac strain markers consistent with chronic overexertion, nutritional deficiencies consistent with a diet of twelve-credit noodles.

The scanner does not see the coals.

The scanner does not see the vault.

The scanner sees a Gofer, and the scanner clears a Gofer, and the Gofer steps out of the alcove and picks up his forty-three-kilogram pack and begins the quiet, meticulous ritual that four hundred and twelve dungeon runs have worn into muscle memory: inventory check, positioning assessment, exit mapping, party evaluation.

```
[Medical clearance: APPROVED]
[WARNING: subject CON below recommended threshold]
[proceed at own risk]
```

*Proceed at own risk.* The station's motto. They should stamp it on the walls.

### 🎵 The Briefing

You wait until **Dren** finishes his own check-in. Until **Renn** opens both eyes and stands, the mana-glow in his forearms cycling from standby to alert. Until **Sable** sheathes the blade she's been inspecting and pushes off the wall with the kinetic indifference of a woman who has already decided this run is beneath her.

They don't expect a briefing from the Gofer. They don't expect anything from the Gofer. The Gofer carries the packs and organizes the drops and stays behind the line and, if something goes wrong, provides a statistical buffer between the casualty rate and the number zero.

You brief them anyway.

> *"Gate 12's layout has shifted since the last Guild survey."*

Your voice is the Gofer voice. Flat. Thin. But the words aren't Gofer words, and **Dren** is the first to notice the difference—the way a man who has survived a party wipe notices anything that deviates from the pattern, the way a smoke detector notices heat.

> *"Three days ago, a new subfloor opened beneath chamber two. Vertical access through a structural collapse that wasn't structural—the dungeon expanded. A new boss signature. Unclassified."*

You hold up the data-pad. The cracked screen displays the forum posts, the cached warning, the partial map. You turn it so all three can see.

> *"Three parties have entered since the subfloor appeared. Two came back short. One hasn't come back."*

**Sable** has uncrossed her arms. **Renn's** mana-glow is cycling faster—a physiological stress response, the channels reacting to the caster's heartrate before his brain catches up. **Dren** hasn't moved. But his hand is on his mace, and the grip is white.

> *"The new endemic is a Symbiant. Cellular-level shapeshifter. Copies appearance, mana-signature, voice, equipment profiles. Good enough to fool visual inspection and standard scanner readouts."*

Silence. The kind that fills a room when someone has said the one thing everyone was afraid to hear.

> *"KillCount_Maki's party went in with four. Came out with three. One of the three wasn't Maki."*

---

**Sable** breaks first.

> *"How do you know this?"* Sharp. The question of a woman who is reassessing the furniture. *"The Guild hasn't posted a Symbiant advisory. If there was a confirmed infiltrator-class—"*

> *"The Guild updates advisories on a seventy-two-hour review cycle. Maki's report was flagged as unverified eleven hours ago. The review won't trigger until tomorrow. By then, tonight's parties are already in the tunnel."*

You say it the way you'd read a bus schedule. The bureaucracy of dying on time.

**Sable** stares at you. The left-hand dominant DPS with forty-seven completions and zero commendations is looking at the Gofer—really *looking*, the way **Mori** looked at you in the alien forest, the first tentative recognition that the shape she filed as furniture might have been misclassified.

> *"...You pulled that from the forums?"*

> *"Forums. Cached server backup. Streamed recordings from Gate 12 clearings dated within the last ninety-six hours. Cross-referenced with the Guild's endemic shift registry, which is public record and updated in real-time, unlike the advisory board."*

Silence.

> *"...Okay."* **Sable** leans against the wall again. Slower this time. The posture of someone recalculating. *"So what's the play, pack-mule?"*

She still calls you pack-mule. But the way she says it has shifted half a degree. The inflection of a question mark where a period used to be.

---

### 🔊 The Marks

> *"Symbiants replicate speech perfectly,"* you say. *"Voice, cadence, vocabulary, accent—exact copies. They process spoken language as acoustic data and reproduce it mathematically. It's pattern matching. High-fidelity, zero comprehension."*

You pull the modded speaker from your chest strap. Hold it up. Don't explain it. Put it back.

> *"But non-linguistic vocalizations—whistling, clicking, lip-trills, the sounds you learn by doing rather than hearing—those are motor-skill dependent. Muscle memory built over years. A Symbiant can copy your voice in seconds. It can't copy the whistle you've been doing since you were six."*

**Dren** speaks. First words since the door.

> *"You want identification calls."*

> *"I want identification calls."*

---

He nods. Once. The economy of a man who has learned that words cost more than they're worth.

> *"I can do a two-tone,"* he says. And then he does it—a low, resonant hum that drops an octave and rises again, produced somewhere in the back of his throat, the sound of a large man making a small noise that no one would ever mistake for language. It's almost musical. Almost sad.

The room is quiet after he does it. The quiet of people hearing something private—a frequency that belongs to a sixty-two-completion tank who walks into dungeon runs carrying a mace older than his career and closes doors softly behind him.

---

**Renn** stands. The mana-glow in his forearms has stabilized. The caster has gone from stress-cycling to *focused*—the shift visible in the luminescence pattern, the chaotic pulse settling into a clean, even throb.

> *"Clicking."* He demonstrates. A sharp, doubled click—tongue against palate, the sound of a man who grew up somewhere where the acoustics mattered. Desert colony, maybe. Settlement architecture where sound carried and quiet was currency. Click-click. Precise. Repeatable. Distinctive.

> *"That work?"* he asks. To you. Not to **Sable**. Not to **Dren**.

To the Gofer.

> *"That works."*

---

**Sable** hasn't picked hers yet. She's watching you with an expression that isn't quite suspicion and isn't quite respect. It lives between them—in the demilitarized zone between *who told the Gofer he could talk* and *why does the Gofer know more than the Guild*.

> *"Whistle,"* she says. And she does it—a short, ascending two-note, the first interval of a melody that she cuts off before it becomes recognizable. The ghost of a song she's not going to share.

Three marks. Three acoustic signatures. Three sounds that a Symbiant—with its flawless vocal mimicry and its mathematically perfect speech replication—cannot fake, because faking them requires a larynx that has spent years learning the specific, idiosyncratic, deeply *personal* micro-motor patterns that produce a sound nobody teaches and everybody invents.

---

They look at you.

> *"Teeth,"* you say.

You do it. Upper incisors against the inside of your lower lip. A thin, hissing *tsst*—more percussive than vocal, more dental than labial. The sound of air passing through a gap that only your teeth create, shaped by the specific malocclusion of a jaw that has spent two years clenching against things it can't say out loud.

Short. Sharp. Unremarkable.

Unmistakable.

---

**Dren** looks at the gate. Then at you. Then at the gate again.

> *"You've done this before,"* he says. Not the dungeon—*this*. The briefing. The tactical assessment. The part where the Gofer stops being furniture and starts being the only person in the room who read the homework.

> *"I've done Gate 12 twice."*

> *"That's not what I mean."*

He holds your gaze for one second. Two. The eyes of a sole survivor—gray, steady, carrying the specific weight of a man who knows what it looks like when the person beside you isn't the person beside you anymore.

Then he picks up his shield. Adjusts the strap. Turns toward the gate.

> *"Gofer calls the marks every chamber transition,"* he says. Over his shoulder. To **Sable** and **Renn**. The voice of a tank who has just decided, without discussion or vote, that the man with the cracked data-pad and the forty-three-kilogram pack is the person in this room most likely to keep them alive.

> *"Anyone fails their call, we stop. We verify. No exceptions."*

**Sable** clicks her tongue. Not her mark—just the sound of a woman swallowing an objection.

> *"...Fine. Budget run with a hall monitor. Why not."*

**Renn** says nothing. His mana-glow pulses steady and clean, and his eyes—open now, both of them, focused—haven't left your face since you pulled up the cached server data.

---

The gate hums its low C-sharp. Green light pools on the staging area floor like antifreeze. Fourteen hours and forty-one minutes until **Belial's** dose. Eleven hundred credits on the other side of five hours of tunnel and chitin and the possibility—the 4.7% possibility—that one of you doesn't walk back out.

The pack is on your back. Forty-three kilograms. The coals sit behind your sternum, banked and patient, and the vault ticks upward by one.

**2.73.**

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The party is marked, briefed, and as ready as four strangers can be for a dungeon that's eating people. **Dren** has given you tactical authority over the identification protocol. **Sable** is skeptical but compliant. **Renn** is quiet and paying attention. The gate is open.

- **Enter the gate** — Five hours. Eleven hundred credits. Standard formation: **Dren** on point, **Sable** flanking, **Renn** in the middle, Gofer in the rear. The dungeon hasn't changed its mind about you. You're still furniture. The furniture just happens to have a sonic grenade and three adrenaline vials and the back door to the universe's operating system.

- **Pull Dren aside first** — The sole survivor. Sixty-two completions. He closed the door softly. He looked at you longer than the others. He's the one most likely to notice if something in the tunnel doesn't add up—and the one most likely to act on it. A thirty-second conversation might be worth the time.

- **Ask Renn about his friendly-fire incidents** — Two incidents in enclosed spaces. You're walking into an enclosed space. The caster who hits the wrong target in tight quarters is a known quantity—and known quantities can be managed, if you know the parameters.

*The gate hums. The light pools. Somewhere on Mars, a woman coughs glass.*

*Fourteen hours. Forty-one minutes.*

*Let's go to work.*
