Transient Entities in scene:

Using the tools available, investigate and manage:
1. Get the campaign bible to understand previous Director decisions
2. Check active foreshadowing — any seeds ready for callback or overdue?
3. Check for convergence points — are multiple plot threads approaching climax at once?
4. Run a spotlight analysis — which NPCs need more or less screen time?
5. For the top 1-2 underserved NPCs, get their full trajectory AND their related foreshadowing seeds
6. Search memory for any unresolved plot threads. Use recall_scene to find specific scenes from earlier in the campaign that are no longer in recent context.
7. If any Transient Entities have become narratively significant, USE the promote_to_catalog tool to make them permanent NPCs.

## All Available Tools
**Arc & Story**
- `get_campaign_bible` — previous Director arc decisions, tension targets, narrative goals
- `get_active_foreshadowing` — all active seeds with callback-ready and overdue flags
- `get_overdue_seeds` — seeds past their maximum payoff window (resolve, escalate, or abandon)
- `get_seeds_for_npc` — all foreshadowing seeds tied to a specific NPC; use alongside get_npc_trajectory
- `get_seeds_by_type` — filter seeds by type: plot, character, mystery, threat, promise, chekhov, relationship
- `get_convergence_points` — detect multiple plot threads approaching climax simultaneously (shared NPCs or resolved dependencies)
- `plant_foreshadowing_seed` — plant a new seed (mystery, threat, promise, Chekhov's gun, etc.)
- `get_spotlight_analysis` — which NPCs are over/underexposed relative to their role
- `get_npc_trajectory` — full arc history and next beat recommendation for a specific NPC
- `create_quest` — establish a new quest/objective in the DB
- `update_quest_status` — mark a quest active, completed, failed, or abandoned
- `complete_quest_objective` — mark a specific sub-objective as done

**Memory & History**
- `search_memory` — semantic search over long-term ChromaDB memories
- `get_critical_memories` — memories flagged as plot-critical
- `mark_memory_critical` — flag a key memory so it never decays (betrayals, revelations, defining moments)
- `get_recent_episodes` — recent turn summaries
- `recall_scene` — keyword search of full turn history in DB; finds scenes from any point in the campaign
- `get_turn_narrative` — get complete text for a specific turn number (use after recall_scene)

**Characters & NPCs**
- `get_npc_details` — full NPC profile: disposition, milestones, secrets
- `list_known_npcs` — all catalogued NPCs
- `get_npc_trajectory` — NPC's narrative arc and recommended next beat
- `update_npc` — record newly learned info about an NPC
- `promote_to_catalog` — promote a transient entity to a permanent catalog NPC
- `summon_npc` / `dismiss_npc` — manage scene presence

**World & Factions**
- `get_world_state` — current location, arc phase, tension level
- `get_character_sheet` — protagonist stats and abilities
- `get_faction_details` — faction goals, members, reputation
- `list_factions` — all known factions
- `search_lore` — search profile lore documents (if available)

Provide a CONCISE investigation report structured as:
- ARC CONTINUITY: What did the last Director pass plan? Are we on track?
- FORESHADOWING STATUS: Seeds ready for payoff, seeds going stale
- NPC SPOTLIGHT: Who needs attention, who's overexposed
- UNRESOLVED THREADS: Plot hooks that need addressing
- PROMOTIONS: Any transient entities you promoted to the permanent catalog
- RECOMMENDATION: What should the next arc beat focus on?"""
