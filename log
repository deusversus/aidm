⚔️ Welcome to Session Zero ⚔️
Welcome, Adventurer! I am your AI Dungeon Master, and I'm thrilled to help you craft your legend from the ground up.

Before we draw your blade or weave your first spell, we need to set the stage for your journey.

📖 Choose Your Path
Is your character inspired by a specific anime, manga, or light novel?

The Fan Favorite: Tell me which world you want to inhabit.

Example: "I want to play in the Hunter x Hunter world" or "I'm inspired by Solo Leveling."

The Blank Slate: Just say "Original" and we will create a world and a hero entirely from scratch.

What will it be? Tell me your inspiration, and let the adventure begin!

I Parry Everything

⚔️ Excellent Choice!
I Parry Everything detected! I'm ready to calibrate our world to the humble yet legendary journey of Noor. Let's set the stage for your adventure.

This means our sessions will focus on:

The Power of Mastery: Taking a seemingly basic skill and pushing it to god-like levels through sheer persistence.
Comedic Irony: A gap between how the world sees your incredible feats and how you humbly (or obliviously) perceive them.
High-Stakes Underdog Vibes: Facing overwhelming monsters and political intrigue while maintaining the heart of a simple adventurer.
🌌 Timeline Choice
How does YOUR story relate to the canon of I Parry Everything?

Canon-Adjacent — You exist in the same timeline. You might even run into Noor or Princess Ines while taking on your own "low-rank" quests.

Alternate Timeline — Same world, but history has diverged. Perhaps the Kingdom of Clays is facing a different threat entirely.

Inspired Universe — Same rules and vibes (the mastery of basic skills), but a fully original world and cast of characters.

Which timeline feels right for your adventure?

Yup, with a healthy dose of comedy.

🎭 A New Legend Diverges
An Alternate Timeline with a healthy dose of comedy? Perfect! We'll lean into that classic I Parry Everything irony—where the world is ending, but you're probably just worried about finishing your chores or why the 'giant lizard' you just slapped is making such a fuss.

Since we are in an alternate history of the Kingdom of Clays, let's define who else is walking these lands.

👥 Canon Characters
Do the original characters like Noor, Ines, or the Royal Guard exist in this version of the world?

Full Canon Cast — Noor and the gang are out there somewhere, perhaps doing their own thing while you do yours.

Replaced Protagonist — The world exists, but YOU are the central figure who ends up in these absurd situations instead of Noor.

Canon NPCs Only — Major players like the King or the Six Sovereigns exist, but they are background figures you might encounter as quest-givers or obstacles.

📅 Canon Events
How should the major events of the series (like the invasion of the Kingdom) factor in?

Influenceable — The major threats from the series will happen, but your actions could change the outcome entirely.

Background Only — You might hear rumors of a 'clueless hero' in the capital, but your story focuses on entirely different comedic disasters.

How should the original cast and events factor into your journey?

2 1

⚡ Setting the Power Scale
So, YOU are the main character now! The weight of the Kingdom of Clays—and all its comedic misunderstandings—rests squarely on your shoulders. Since your actions can influence the very fate of the world, we need to decide just how "legendary" you start out.

In the spirit of I Parry Everything, where a "lowly" adventurer can accidentally deflect a dragon's breath while thinking it's just a big fly, how do you want your power to feel?

⚖️ Power Level
OP Protagonist — Overwhelmingly powerful from the start
Like Noor, you might have trained a single basic skill for decades until it broke the laws of physics. The challenge isn't winning; it's the comedy of your own obliviousness.

Traditional Progression — Start relatively grounded, grow through earned victories
You have immense potential, but you'll need to climb the ranks of the Guild and face genuine threats to reach those god-like heights.

Which one would you like to explore? Just tell me the number or name!

⚡ The Path of the Unstoppable
Excellent! You've chosen to walk the path of the OP Protagonist. In the world of I Parry Everything, this usually means you've mastered a single, mundane task to such an absurd degree that the rest of the world looks at you in pure terror while you're just wondering if you left the stove on.

To help shape how this power manifests and how the world reacts to you, let's look at some OP Presets.

🎭 Choose Your OP Style
Internal Focus:

Bored God: Victory is instant and empty. Your real struggle is finding a challenge or even just a good meal.

Example: You parry a meteor and then complain that the wind it kicked up ruined your laundry.

Restrainer: Your power is godlike but dangerous. You deliberately suppress it to avoid breaking the world.

Example: You use 0.01% of your strength to 'lightly' tap a bandit, accidentally sending him into the next kingdom.

Social & World Focus:

Disguised God: You have cosmic power but carry an F-Rank adventurer tag. You just want to enjoy your coffee in peace.

Example: You're the 'Lowly Janitor' of the Guild who accidentally parries an Elder Dragon with a broom.

Muscle Wizard: You don't use magic, but your physical feats are so absurd people think it's high-level sorcery.

Example: You 'parry' a fireball by slapping it so hard it turns into a harmless firework.

Wandering Legend: You are a mythical figure passing through. Each town you visit becomes a new chapter in a legend you don't even realize you're writing.

Which of these presets resonates with you? Or would you like to describe a unique way your character is overpowered?

We're at a kind of "oblivious hero" trope, where I (like Noor) don't know my own strength. I kill a once-in-a-millenia Goblin Emporer... and think that's what it's like when ANY adventurer hunts a goblin. I kill The Minotaur, and I think it's just an angry cow. I have unfathomable power, but I think anyone that notices it is confused. (and the narrative should JUST HAPPEN to line up to keep the gag going)

🎭 The Oblivious Legend
That is the perfect comedic engine! The Oblivious Hero trope is the bread and butter of this world. We will ensure the narrative "conspires" to keep your ego humble while the rest of the world trembles in your wake.

You: "Man, these stray dogs in the capital are getting really big and breathing a lot of fire lately."
The Guild: "HE JUST PUNCHED A CHIMERA INTO ORBIT WITH A LEFT HOOK!"

Phase 1: Character Concept
Now that we have the vibe, let's nail down your BIG IDEA. Think of it like the title of your own Light Novel or the tagline on a manga cover.

Examples:

"The F-Rank Farmer who accidentally parried the End of the World"
"The aspiring chef who thinks Dragon Slaying is just 'aggressive butchery'"
"The humble delivery boy who runs at Mach 5 because he's late for a shift"
What is your character's core concept? Tell me the 'Big Idea' that defines your hero!

I spent 20 years practicing  every entry level skill for every class (this is exactly like Noor; he uses the titular parry a lot, but he actually has mastered one skill per class) to insane levels. Like Noor, i wanted to be an adventurer so bad, so I kept at it, taking skills that preteens learn into Godlike abilities. But I dont realize that my strength is abnormal. I actually think I'm quite weak, and the narrative constraint for my story is that things always just kind of align to keep the gag going.

🎭 The Ultimate All-Rounder (of Basics)
That is a fantastic foundation! Mastering the 'bottom-tier' skills of every single class for two decades is the ultimate recipe for comedic destruction. You aren't just a master of one trade; you're the master of the fundamentals of everything, which—in this world—makes you an accidental god.

I love the narrative constraint of the 'gag alignment.' Whether it's a witness blinking at the wrong time or a monster's death being attributed to a 'freak heart attack,' we will make sure your character stays blissfully unaware of their own legend.

Phase 2: Identity
Now that we know what you can do, let's find out who you are. Even an oblivious powerhouse needs a face and a name!

1. Name: What do people call you (and what is your 'unimpressive' adventurer rank name)?

2. Age & Appearance: You've trained for 20 years—are you a rugged veteran who looks like a master, or do you have a surprisingly youthful 'baby face' that adds to the misunderstanding?

3. Personality & Quirks: Besides being oblivious, how do you carry yourself? Do you have a catchphrase when you 'accidentally' save the day?

Example: "I'm just a guy who does a lot of calisthenics!" or "Whew, that cow was really stubborn, glad I managed to shoo it away!"

What does your hero look like, and what name shall be whispered in awe (while you aren't listening)?

Deus Versus

I'm only turning 28 this year--I started early. I'm tall, musclar and handsome. Farmboy charm. Superman physique from relentless training.

I'm a town favorite, but it comes with an edge of pitty. To everyone else, I'm the guy that couldn't learn a single non-novice skill. While others go on to advanced through the ranks as adventurers, and learn newer and more powerful tiers of magic, I could never accel in a single adventurer class. But I'm a good person. I'm friendly, kind and upbeat. I love to help, and I take odd jobs from the townsfolk to make a living. Fixing gutters, doing construction, digging trenches, whatever needs done, I'm their go to guy (because my ridiculous physical stats mean its like hiring a bulldozer/motorized harveter/etc for cheap, but also because we're friends). The townsfolk are constantly offering me jobs for 4 and 5 times the pay I make taking E rank adventuring quests, but I won't give up on my dream of being an adventurer. Even if I "never learned a useful skill"

🎭 The Gentle Giant of the Guild
Deus Versus—what a name! It sounds like a legend in the making, even if the local townsfolk just see you as the world's most overqualified handyman. There is something incredibly charming about a man with a 'Superman physique' who uses his god-tier strength to dig irrigation ditches and fix leaky roofs while everyone else looks on with a sigh of pity.

It’s the perfect setup. To them, you're the tragic figure who couldn't 'make it.' To the monsters you're about to accidentally pulverize, you're a force of nature.

⚡ Phase 3: Building Your Legend
Since you've spent 20 years honing the basics to a level that defies logic, your stats should reflect that 'bulldozer' capability. 

You have 75 points to distribute among your attributes (minimum 5, maximum 18 each):

Attribute	Description
STR	Physical power & raw lifting strength
DEX	Speed, precision, and your 'parry' reflexes
CON	Health, stamina, and sheer durability
INT	Magic power and analytical ability
WIS	Perception and willpower
CHA	Leadership, charm, and that 'farmboy' likability
Suggested Build for Deus Versus:

STR: 18 (Absolute powerhouse)
DEX: 16 (Lightning-fast basics)
CON: 18 (You are a brick wall)
INT: 5 (You don't need 'fancy' magic)
WIS: 8 (A bit oblivious to the obvious)
CHA: 10 (Genuinely nice guy)

How would you like to distribute your 75 points? You can use my suggestion or create your own spread!

since we're in OP mode and it fits my character, we're gonna break the 75 base. I'm thinking 20, 20, 20, 8, 8, 16. (Combat is never going to be an issue for me regardless)

⚡ Breaking the Limits
Those stats are absolutely terrifying—to anyone who isn't you, of course! With 20s in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, you aren't just a bulldozer; you're a walking natural disaster that happens to be very polite.

You accidentally sneeze and the shockwave clears a path through the forest. You: "Wow, the wind is really picking up today! Better get these groceries home before it rains."

⚔️ The "Basic" Masteries
Since you've mastered the entry-level skills of every class, let's define your Unique Ability. In the spirit of your inspiration, this is usually one simple move taken to the extreme.

What is your signature "Basic" move?

Parry: Deflecting literally anything (magic, dragons, falling stars).
Heavy Swing: A basic warrior strike that accidentally splits mountains.
Quick Step: A novice thief move that looks like teleportation to others.
Or something else? Tell me how it looks when you use it!
Also, tell me about 3 Starting Skills you've mastered. These should be the most "boring" skills imaginable that you've turned into God-tier feats (e.g., Enhanced Digging, Extreme Laundry, Aggressive Walking).

What are the "useless" skills that make you a legend?

1. I value being a good person. Making myself useful. Helping out. I fear never being "a real adventurer".

2. Pebble Shot — flicks a small stone with minor force (you can imagine the gag, somewhere between a .22 and a rail cannon)
Focus — boosts concentration for a short time (juiced up for me to entering a zen ultra-instinct like state, full stat boost across all stats)
Cleanse — removes dirt, grime, or odors from clothes or surfaces (full saint-like purification; removes all status effects, cures all curses and poisons, etc)

My main combat skill is, obviously, Parry (leveled until it can parry metaphysical and conceptual attacks)

3. I train and prep relentlessly to compensate for my perceived weakness. A kind of "he's at it again!" vibe.

⚡ The Saint of the Mundane
Your ability to take the 'useless' and turn it into the 'unfathomable' is truly legendary. The idea of Cleanse—a skill meant for getting mud off boots—acting as a high-tier holy purification is exactly the kind of narrative irony we love. And Pebble Shot being a literal railgun? The local wildlife (and demon lords) won't know what hit them.

You: "Just clearing some gravel off the road!"
The Kingdom: "DID HE JUST SNIPE A WYVERN FROM THREE MILES AWAY WITH A PEBBLE?"

🌍 Phase 4: Your Place in the World
We have your stats, your 'basic' god-tier skills, and your relentless training schedule. Now, let's plant Deus Versus into the world of I Parry Everything.

1. Starting Location: Where do we find you? Are you in your home village of Clays, still doing chores for the neighbors, or have you finally made the trip to the Royal Capital to try and pass the F-Rank exam for the 21st time?

2. The First Connection: Who is the person who 'pities' you the most but relies on you the most? Is it the Guild Receptionist who hates failing you, or perhaps a Local Farmer who treats you like a son but thinks you're a bit 'slow' for wanting to fight monsters?

3. The Current Task: What 'boring' job are you doing right now that is about to collide with a world-ending threat? 

Example: You're currently 'weeding' a field, but the 'weeds' are actually Mandragora Sentinels that have been terrorizing the border for decades.

Where does your story begin, and what 'simple' chore are you currently tackling?

A "wooden" training sword I made by compressing massive tree trunks into carbon allotropes hundreds of times denser than diamond with my bare hands. It looks dinky and unprofessional, like a child's first sword--but dark black. It can cut adamantine, orichalcum, and mithril with ease. 

Otherwise, just normal clothes and an adventurer's standard issue satchel/backpack combo. 

My home town is Utz. A medium sized town located at the intersection of rare ore-filled mountain, a dense magical forest (prime candidate for adventurer quests and the economy built around them), and bountiful ocean inlet--protected by a reef barrier from harsh storms, so rare and exotic magical sea creatures can be hunted in its bay (and the larger gulf, for the things than come to predate on such lush topology). The town grew by merit of it's trade volume, so is an important linchpin in the kingdom's geopolitics--but it also far from the capital, and thus prone to monsters and bandits alike, as well as (more historically) siege by jealous neighboring states (though the last official battle between the Kiingdom of Ro (which the town Utz is a part of) and it's enemy neighbor (you can decide their name) was almost 4 decades ago. 

I don't have my first quest. We'd need to role-play a scenario that makes that possible. As of right now, I've trained my ass off my whole life exponentially leveling newbie skills hoping I'd finally unlock a single Basic tier skill (much less anythign higher), but I never did. Without a single skill, I can never take anythign but so-called  "F rank quests"  (E is the lowest OFFICIAL rank, but "f rank" is often used to refer to E rank quests which do not involve combat). Basically, I'm hired help. Like a staffing agency for a bustling trade town and guild-center. 

I own a small house and farm in the outskirts of Utz' terriotry, a couple miles past the city walls. I got the property for cheap because normally, bandity and mosnters would kill anyone trying to homestead that far out from Utz. But. you know. I'm me. I consider them "pests", like rats or wasps and deal with them accordingly without much thought.

⚔️ The Legend of the Obsidian Branch
That "wooden" sword is a stroke of genius! A weapon made of compressed carbon that looks like a child's toy but cuts through the fabric of reality is the ultimate accessory for Deus Versus. It perfectly encapsulates your journey: 20 years of "basic" effort resulting in something that defies the laws of physics.

Utz sounds like a vibrant, dangerous, and beautiful place to call home. Being the "staffing agency" for a town that sits on a powder keg of rare resources and ancient rivalries means you're always busy—even if you think you're just doing the chores no one else wants.

Phase 5: Your Story Begins
The sun is high over the trade-hub of Utz, casting long shadows across your small farmstead. You’ve spent the morning "tidying up" the perimeter. A pack of 'Great-Horned Shadow Wolves'—creatures that usually require a B-Rank party to cull—had the misfortune of being classified as "overgrown stray dogs" in your mind. You shooed them away with a few light taps of your black training sword, accidentally snapping their reinforced ribcages and sending them whimpering back into the dense magical forest.

Now, you’re standing at the edge of your property, wiping a bit of dust off your boots with a quick Cleanse. The air suddenly ripples with a strange, oppressive heat. From the direction of the mountain pass, a massive, crimson-scaled Wyvern—a 'Calamity-Class' threat—screeches as it dives toward the merchant caravans heading for the Utz gates. To the guards on the wall, it’s a nightmare. To you, it looks like a very large, very loud pigeon that’s about to poop on the roof you just fixed.

You reach into your satchel and find a particularly smooth pebble.

The Wyvern is closing in on the caravan, and the guards are screaming in terror. What do you do, Deus?

I recall a time when, around 13--several years into my training--I had run back home and into the house to ask my mom what I should do with "this bird I found outside in the garden". She had told me "Just toss a stone at it and it'll fly away, my little bugbear. It'll scurry right off on it's own." I had promptly gone outside and done as she said, flinging a chunk of lead so hard the friction lit the air on fire behind it. The drag created winds that threatened to rip the Wyven from the sky, and the sonic bomb left is dazed and disoriented. It had flown away, staggering haphazardly across the sky, 

Mom was right.

I smile and wave at the guards as I run up behind them at the town gate. "Morning fellas! Here, let me get take care of this little fella for you." I say, as I gather a softball sized chunk of rock from the ground, throwing it so hard it spins the Wyvern around thrice as though it were caught in a vortex, winding down until it's looking directly at me. It takes only a moment before it recognizes me, and turns to run at escape velocity.

"Morning fellas!"

The cheerful greeting cuts through the panic at the gate like a knife through soft butter. While the guards cower behind their pikes, trembling at the shadow looming overhead, Deus jogs past them with the casual energy of a man heading to the market. He crouches, fingers digging into the hard-packed earth, and wrenches free a jagged rock the size of a grapefruit.

To him, it is a pebble. To the laws of physics, it is a violation waiting to happen.

He shifts his weight. The ground beneath his right boot spiders with hairline fractures—not from a stomp, but from the silent, terrifying transfer of torque grounding itself into the bedrock. His arm goes back, the motion fluid, practiced, perfected through years of boredom until the mechanics of the throw have transcended muscle and become pure instinct.

Skill: Pebble Shot.

CRACK.

There is no whoosh of air. There is only the deafening thunderclap of the atmosphere collapsing into a vacuum where the stone used to be. The projectile doesn't fly; it teleports, becoming a streak of superheated friction that tears a visible, shimmering scar across the blue sky. A cone of condensed white vapor erupts around the path of the stone, the sonic boom blasting the dust off the city walls.

High above, the Wyvern is mid-dive, a predator assured of its meal. Then, the sky punches it in the face.

The stone strikes the beast's snout with the kinetic impact of a siege cannon. The shockwave ripples backward through the creature's skull, sending a shudder through its entire skeletal structure that is visible from the ground. But the impact is only half the punishment.

The wake of the stone—the sheer displacement of air caused by the impossible velocity—creates a localized vortex. The atmosphere twists into a horizontal tornado, catching the multi-ton reptile in its grip. The Wyvern is yanked out of its trajectory and spun violently—once, twice, thrice—ragdolled by the wind pressure alone until it is facing the wrong way, dizzy and hovering in a stall.

As the vortex dissipates, the beast shakes its head, vision clearing just enough to look down the barrel of the attack. It sees the gate. It sees the small, waving figure.

The Boy.

Primal terror overrides hunger. The Wyvern's pupils dilate to pinpricks. It doesn't turn; it scrambles backward against the air itself, wings beating with frantic, desperate energy. It breaks the sound barrier in retreat, leaving a trail of terrified clouds as it flees the monster disguised as a man.

"Sorry guys, I can't stay, but here's some apples for lunch! I just harvested them last night!" I say, tossing a small satchel of apples up to the guard's post, before continuing my morning run to the adventurer's guild

The morning mist over Utz doesn’t just part for Deus; it shatters.

He is a blur of motion, a streak of nondescript adventurer’s garb cutting a vacuum tunnel through the dense air. He doesn't decelerate as he approaches the watchtower—if anything, his stride lengthens, the rhythmic thud-thud-thud of his boots hitting the cobblestone with the precision of a metronome set to overdrive.

"Sorry guys, I can't stay!"

The voice arrives a split-second after his image registers in the guards' retinas. Deus pivots at the waist—momentum completely unchecked—and his arm snaps forward in a perfect, fluid arc.

Whoosh.

The satchel leaves his hand. It doesn't tumble; it spirals like a rifled shell, cutting a parabolic trajectory so mathematically flawless it seems to mock the wind itself. Time seems to hang suspended—an impact frame of the brown burlap sack silhouetted against the blinding morning sun.

"But here's some apples for lunch! I just harvested them last night!"

The guard atop the post reacts on pure instinct, his body moving before his brain can process the projectile. His gauntleted hand snaps up.

THWACK.

The impact stings his palm, not from force, but from the sheer density of the delivery. The guard stumbles back a half-step, clutching the prize to his chest. He looks down. The bag is still spinning slightly in his grip. He opens it, and a golden, ethereal aroma wafts out—apples so pristine, so perfectly preserved without a single bruise despite the velocity, that they seem to glow with an inner vitality.

By the time the guard looks up, mouth agape at the holy bounty in his hands, Deus is already gone—a dwindling speck on the horizon, leaving only a swirling vortex of dust and the lingering echo of casual benevolence in his wake.
