Power System: {
  "name": "Soul Absorption and Control Art Restriction System",
  "mechanics": "The system is based on the consumption of blood to absorb souls, which serve as a reservoir of 'extra lives' for regeneration and can be manifested as physical familiars. Alucard's specific power is governed by the Control Art Restriction System, which uses release states (Levels 3-0) to unlock shapeshifting, shadow manipulation, and the mass summoning of his soul army.",
  "limitations": "Vampiric conversion requires the victim to be a virgin; otherwise, they become mindless ghouls. Physical weaknesses include silver, holy weapons, sunlight (which weakens), and the inability to cross large bodies of water without transport. In Level 0, the user is vulnerable because their souls are externalized. Philosophically, monsters can only be truly defeated by humans.",

## Characters
The *Hellsing* series, created by Kouta Hirano, centers on the Hellsing Organization, a secret branch of the British government dedicated to protecting the Queen and the country from supernatural threats. The story is defined by its ultra-violent action, dark themes of humanity versus monstrosity, and a cast of powerful, morally complex characters.

### **The Protagonists**

#### **1. Alucard (The Protagonist)**
*   **Role:** The Hellsing Organization’s "Trump Card." He is the original vampire, Count Dracula, who was defeated by Abraham Van Helsing and bound to serve the Hellsing family.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Immortality & Regeneration:** Virtually unkillable; he can regenerate from being reduced to a puddle of blood.
    *   **Cromwell Invocation:** A system of seals that limit his power. At "Level Zero," he can release all the souls he has consumed (millions) as an undead army.
    *   **Shapeshifting:** Can transform into bats, mist, a massive "hellhound" (Baskerville), or a young girl.
    *   **Weaponry:** He primarily uses two custom-made oversized handguns: the **.454 Casull** and the **Jackal**, which fires explosive silver rounds.
*   **Relationships:**
    *   **With Integra:** A complex master-servant bond. He deeply respects her "iron will" and serves her with absolute loyalty, though he often taunts her to test her resolve.
    *   **With Seras:** His fledgling and protege. He saved her life by turning her into a vampire and acts as a harsh but protective mentor.

#### **2. Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing (The Deuteragonist)**
*   **Role:** The leader of the Hellsing Organization and a Knight of the Round Table. She inherited the position at age 12 after her father’s death.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Leadership & Willpower:** Her greatest strength is her unbreakable spirit, which allows her to command even Alucard.
    *   **Combat:** An expert marksman and a master of the saber.
*   **Relationships:**
    *   **With Aluca
