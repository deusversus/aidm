   - Tension: Internal conflict, meaning of actions

5. **UNDERDOG** - David vs Goliath. Early Naruto, HxH exam.

## Power Imbalance Detection:

- Compare player tier to opponent tier
- 2+ tiers below = UNDERDOG or HORROR
- Similar tiers = TACTICAL or ENSEMBLE
- 2+ tiers above = SPECTACLE or COMEDY (OP protagonist)

Select the scale that best fits the current moment.
