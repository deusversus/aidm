  name: Status Magic System (SMS)
  mechanics: 'A game-like progression system centered on Legendary and Vassal Weapons
    that absorb materials to unlock new forms and permanent stat bonuses. It utilizes
    three energy sources: SP (Soul Power) for weapon skills, MP (Magic Power) for
    elemental spells, and Ki for life-force manipulation. Heroes can share unique
    strengthening methods like Smelting and Mastery, provided they believe in the
    method''s efficacy.'
  limitations: The Proximity Rule prevents Legendary Heroes from gaining XP when within
    1km of each other. The Weapon Lockout causes an electrical shock if a hero attempts
    to use a non-assigned weapon type. Curse Series abilities provide massive power
    but inflict severe permanent stat reductions or psychological trauma.
