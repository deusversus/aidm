  name: Magic (Visualization-based)
  mechanics: 'Magic is powered by Mana and structured through mathematical or linguistic
    formulas. Its ultimate law is Visualization: a mage can only manifest what they
    can clearly imagine. It involves mana detection, suppression, and the use of specific
    techniques like Human Magic, Curses, or Goddess Magic.'
  limitations: Magic is rigid and limited by the caster's logic; if a mage cannot
    visualize a result, the spell fails regardless of mana levels. Mages are physically
    vulnerable 'glass cannons' who are easily defeated by warriors if they get within
    a 5-meter range.
