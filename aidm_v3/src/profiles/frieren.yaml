  name: Magic (Visualization-based)
  mechanics: 'Magic is powered by Mana and structured through mathematical or linguistic formulas. Its ultimate law is Visualization: a mage can only manifest what they can clearly imagine. It involves mana detection, suppression, and the use of specific techniques like Human Magic, Curses, or Goddess Magic.'
  limitations: Magic is rigid and limited by the caster's logic; if a mage cannot visualize a result, the spell fails regardless of mana levels. Mages are physically vulnerable 'glass cannons' who are easily defeated by warriors if they get within a 5-meter range.
  tiers:
  - 9th Class (Apprentice)
  - 1st Class (Elite)
  - Great Mages
  - Demons
