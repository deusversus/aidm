  name: Cursed Energy
  mechanics: Power is fueled by negative human emotions like fear and anger. It is
    used for physical reinforcement, unique innate or inherited Cursed Techniques
    engraved in the brain, and advanced Reverse Cursed Techniques that multiply negative
    energy to create positive healing energy. Special phenomena like Black Flash occur
    when energy is applied within 0.000001 seconds of a physical strike.
  limitations: Sorcerers are physically human without constant energy reinforcement.
    Usage is governed by Binding Vows where power is gained through sacrifice or revealing
    one's technique. Heavenly Restrictions can also strip a user of energy in exchange
    for physical prowess. Domain Expansions require immense energy and can be countered
    by more refined domains or anti-domain techniques.
