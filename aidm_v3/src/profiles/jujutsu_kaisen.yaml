  name: Cursed Energy
  mechanics: Power is fueled by negative human emotions like fear and anger. It is used for physical reinforcement, unique innate or inherited Cursed Techniques engraved in the brain, and advanced Reverse Cursed Techniques that multiply negative energy to create positive healing energy. Special phenomena like Black Flash occur when energy is applied within 0.000001 seconds of a physical strike.
  limitations: Sorcerers are physically human without constant energy reinforcement. Usage is governed by Binding Vows where power is gained through sacrifice or revealing one's technique. Heavenly Restrictions can also strip a user of energy in exchange for physical prowess. Domain Expansions require immense energy and can be countered by more refined domains or anti-domain techniques.
