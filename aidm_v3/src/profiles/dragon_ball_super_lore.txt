## Sequels
*Dragon Ball Super* (DBS) is a "midquel" series that takes place during the 10-year timeskip between the defeat of Kid Buu and the final "Peaceful World" episodes of *Dragon Ball Z*. Since its debut in 2015, the series has expanded into a complex web of anime, manga, and films with distinct continuities.

### **1. Sequels and Ongoing Storylines**
While the *Dragon Ball Super* anime concluded in 2018 with the Tournament of Power, the story has continued through films and the monthly manga.

*   **Canon Films (Direct Sequels):**
    *   **Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018):** A direct sequel to the anime series. It reintroduces Broly into the official canon and explores the history of the Saiyan race.
    *   **Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero (2022):** Set several years after *Broly*, this film shifts the focus to Gohan and Piccolo, introducing "Gohan Beast" and "Orange Piccolo" forms.
*   **Manga-Exclusive Arcs:**
    The manga, illustrated by Toyotaro, continues the story past the anime's ending:
    *   **Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga:** Features the ancient wizard **Moro**, who consumes the life force of planets.
    *   **Survivor Granolah Saga:** Introduces Granolah, the last of a race wiped out by Saiyans, and features the debut of **Ultra Ego Vegeta** and **Black Frieza**.
    *   **Super Hero Saga:** A manga adaptation of the 2022 film with an expanded prequel arc focusing on Goten and Trunks as high school superheroes.

### **2. Prequels and Related Series**
*   **Dragon Ball Daima (2024):** A new anime series set **between** *Dragon Ball Z* and *Dragon Ball Super*. It follows Goku and his friends after they are turned small by a conspiracy in the Demon Realm. It is considered part of the main continuity but focuses more on adventure than the high-stakes power scaling of *Super*.
*   **Jaco the Galactic Patrolman:** A prequel manga by Akira Toriyama set 10 years before the original *Dragon Ball*. It introduces Jaco and Bulma’s sister, Tights, both of whom become recurring characters in *Super*.
*   **Super Dragon Ball Heroes:** A promotional "What-If" anime and game series. It is **non-canon** and features "fan-service" scenarios like Super Saiyan 4 vs. Super Saiyan Blue, but it is not connected to the main *Super* storyline.

### **3. Continuity and Timeline Differences**
*Dragon Ball Super* exists in two primary "canons" that follow the same general plot but differ significantly in execution.

| Feature | Anime Continuity | Manga Continuity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Scaling** | Generally higher; uses "Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken." | More grounded; uses "Mastered Super Saiyan Blue." |
| **Goku Black Arc** | Trunks uses "Super Saiyan Rage" and a Spirit Bomb sword. | Trunks remains a support character; Goku uses a "Hakai" (Destruction) technique. |
| **Tournament of Power** | Gohan is a secondary player; Kefla is defeated by Goku. | Gohan is much stronger and fights Kefla to a double-knockout. |
| **Ultra Instinct** | Portrayed as a transformation with a distinct silver-haired form. | Portrayed more as a state of mind that Goku can use in any form. |
| **Resurrection 'F'** | Full story arc (Episodes 15–27). | Almost entirely skipped; only mentioned in passing. |

### **4. Dragon Ball Super vs. Dragon Ball GT**
*   **Status:** *Dragon Ball Super* is the official canon continuation of the manga. *Dragon Ball GT* is an anime-original sequel produced by Toei Animation in the 1990s.
*   **Timeline Conflict:** *Super* takes place in Age 778–780, while *GT* begins in Age 789. However, *Super* introduces concepts (God Ki, Multiverses, Whis/Beerus) that are never mentioned in *GT*, making them effectively alternate timelines.
*   **The "End of Z" Problem:** Fans often debate if *Super* will eventually retcon the final episodes of *Dragon Ball Z* (where Goku meets Uub). As of 2025, the *Super* manga has reached Age 783, bringing it within one year of the original series' conclusion.

### **5. Current Status (2025)**
Following the passing of Akira Toriyama in March 2024, the *Dragon Ball Super* manga went on a year-long hiatus. It officially returned in **February 2025** with **Chapter 104**, a special one-shot focusing on Goten and Trunks. **Volume 24** was released in April 2025, concluding the *Super Hero* arc. The series is expected to continue under the full creative leadership of **Toyotaro**, Toriyama's hand-picked successor.

## Characters
*Dragon Ball Super* (DBS) continues the story of Son Goku and his friends after the defeat of Majin Buu. It introduces the concept of the multiverse, divine beings, and power levels that transcend traditional Super Saiyan forms.

### **Main Protagonists**

| Character | Role | Key Abilities | Key Relationships |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Son Goku** | Primary Protagonist | **Ultra Instinct**, Super Saiyan God/Blue, Kamehameha, Instant Transmission. | Husband to Chi-Chi; father to Gohan and Goten; rival/best friend to Vegeta; student of Whis. |
| **Vegeta** | Deuteragonist | **Ultra Ego** (Manga), SSJ Blue Evolution, Final Flash, Forced Spirit Fission. | Husband to Bulma; father to Trunks and Bulla; mentor to Cabba (Universe 6). |
| **Son Gohan** | Scholar & Warrior | **Gohan Beast**, Ultimate Gohan, Masenko. | Son of Goku; husband to Videl; father to Pan; mentored by Piccolo. |
| **Piccolo** | Strategist & Mentor | **Orange Piccolo**, Special Beam Cannon, Regeneration, Gigantification. | Former enemy; surrogate father figure/mentor to Gohan and Pan. |
| **Android 17** | Breakout Hero | Infinite Stamina, Energy Barrier, Superhuman Speed. | Twin brother of Android 18; winner/MVP of the Tournament of Power. |

### **Divine Mentors & Neutral Figures**
*   **Beerus (God of Destruction):** Initially the antagonist of the first arc, he becomes a neutral mentor. He possesses **Hakai** (Destruction) energy and seeks a "Super Saiyan God" to challenge him.
*   **Whis (Angel):** Beerus’s attendant and the most powerful being in Universe 7. He mentors Goku and Vegeta, teaching them to master **God Ki** and Ultra Instinct. He has the ability to rewind time by three minutes.

### **Primary Antagonists (By Arc)**

1.  **Beerus (Battle of Gods Arc):** A deity who threatens to destroy Earth unless he finds a Super Saiyan God. His role is to push Goku into the realm of divine power.
2.  **Golden Frieza (Resurrection ‘F’ Arc):** Revived by his remnants, Frieza achieves a new "Golden" form through training. He is driven by a singular obsession with killing Goku.
3.  **Hit (Universe 6 Arc):** A legendary assassin from Universe 6. While not "evil," he serves as the primary antagonist of the tournament. His signature ability is **Time-Skip**, allowing him to jump forward in time by fractions of a second.
4.  **Goku Black & Zamasu (Future Trunks Arc):**
    *   **Goku Black:** An alternate-timeline Zamasu who stole Goku’s body. He uses **Super Saiyan Rosé**.
    *   **Zamasu:** A Supreme Kai-in-training with a "Zero Mortals Plan." He is immortal and eventually fuses with Goku Black to become **Fused Zamasu**.
5.  **Jiren (Universe Survival Arc):** The strongest mortal in the multiverse, representing Universe 11. He is a "force of nature" antagonist who values absolute strength over teamwork, forcing Goku to unlock **Ultra Instinct**.
6.  **Broly (DBS: Broly):** A "noble savage" with infinite potential. Exiled as a child, he is used by his father and Frieza as a weapon against Goku and Vegeta.
7.  **Moro (Galactic Patrol Prisoner Arc - Manga):** An ancient sorcerer who consumes the life energy of entire planets to grow stronger.
8.  **Gas & Granolah (Granolah the Survivor Arc - Manga):** Warriors who use the Dragon Balls to wish themselves into becoming the "strongest in the universe," leading to a clash of ideologies regarding power and revenge.

### **Key Relationships & Dynamics**
*   **The Goku-Vegeta Rivalry:** In *Super*, this evolves from bitter hatred into a "friendly" but intense competitive partnership. They often train together under Whis to reach the level of the Gods.
*   **The Universe 6 Saiyans:** Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale look up to the Universe 7 Saiyans. Vegeta takes on a mentor role for Cabba, while Goku pushes Caulifla and Kale to reach Super Saiyan 2 and eventually fuse into **Kefla**.
*   **The Redemption of Frieza:** Though he remains a villain at heart, Frieza is forced to cooperate with the heroes during the Tournament of Power, leading to one of the series' most iconic moments where he and Goku fight side-by-side to eliminate Jiren.
*   **Bulma’s Role:** As the world's greatest genius, Bulma remains the logistical backbone of the group, providing technology (like the Time Machine and Dragon Radar) and even befriending Beerus and Whis through Earth's cuisine.

## Power System
The power system in *Dragon Ball Super* (DBS) expands on the classic "Ki" system of *Dragon Ball Z* by introducing divine energy, specialized godly techniques, and a multiversal hierarchy.

### **1. Core Mechanics: Ki vs. Godly Ki**
The foundation of power remains **Ki** (life energy), composed of three elements: *Genki* (energy), *Yuki* (courage), and *Shoki* (mind).
*   **Normal Ki:** Accessible to all living beings. It can be sensed by anyone trained in Ki detection.
*   **Godly Ki:** A denser, more refined version of Ki used by deities (Angels, Gods of Destruction, Kais). 
    *   **Detection:** Mortals cannot "sense" Godly Ki; they only feel a heavy, crushing pressure. Only those with Godly Ki can track it.
    *   **Containment:** Unlike normal Ki, which "leaks" from the body as an aura, Godly Ki requires the user to keep their energy packed tightly inside to prevent waste, a concept known as **Perfect Ki Control**.

### **2. Abilities & Transformations**
DBS shifts the focus from simple power multipliers to specialized "states of being" and techniques.
*   **Super Saiyan God (SSG):** Achieved via a ritual or divine training. It grants Godly Ki, a slimmer physique, and high speed/stamina efficiency.
*   **Super Saiyan Blue (SSB):** A Super Saiyan transformation applied to the SSG state. It is immensely powerful but has high stamina drain.
    *   *Manga Variation:* **Perfected SSB** involves sealing the overflowing aura inside the body to maintain 100% power.
*   **Ultra Instinct (UI):** A technique of the Angels where the body moves and reacts without conscious thought.
    *   **Sign (Omen):** The defensive-heavy incomplete version.
    *   **Mastered/Perfected (Silver hair):** Full synchronization of offense and defense.
    *   **True Ultra Instinct (Manga):** Goku’s personal evolution that allows him to use his Saiyan emotions while maintaining the UI state.
*   **Ultra Ego (UE):** Vegeta’s counterpart to UI, taught by Beerus. It converts damage taken into raw power and fighting spirit.
*   **Spirit Control:** A Yardrat discipline that manipulates the "spirit" (Ki) on a molecular level.
    *   **Forced Spirit Fission:** Allows the user to "beat" energy out of an opponent, undoing fusions or absorptions.

### **3. Rules & Limitations**
*   **Stamina & Physical Strain:** High-tier forms like SSB and UI put immense pressure on the body. If the user’s stamina drops, the form collapses, often leaving them defenseless.
*   **The "Glass Cannon" Rule:** Even the strongest fighters (like Goku) can be hurt by weak attacks (like a laser or bullet) if they drop their Ki guard. Durability is active, not passive.
*   **Emotional State:** UI requires a "still heart," while UE and Saiyan forms thrive on aggression. Mixing these can lead to instability.
*   **Magic vs. Ki:** Magic (used by Moro or Babidi) operates on different rules. It can bypass raw power gaps through "hax" (e.g., turning a stronger opponent into candy or draining their life force).

### **4. Power Tiers & Hierarchy**
The series established a rigid divine hierarchy that mortals are only beginning to bridge:
1.  **Zeno (Omni-King):** Not a fighter, but has the power to erase entire universes instantly.
2.  **Grand Priest:** The strongest combatant; father of the Angels.
3.  **Angels (e.g., Whis, Vados):** Always in a state of Ultra Instinct; significantly stronger than Gods of Destruction.
4.  **Gods of Destruction (e.g., Beerus, Champa):** Possess "Hakai" (destruction energy).
5.  **Supreme Kais:** Deities of creation; generally weaker than top-tier mortals.
6.  **Top-Tier Mortals:** Characters like Goku, Vegeta, Jiren, Broly, Gohan (Beast), and Black Frieza who have reached "God-class" strength.

### **5. Progression**
Progression in DBS is no longer just about "getting stronger" but about **refining technique**.
*   **Mortal to Divine:** Characters bridge the gap by training with deities to acquire Godly Ki.
*   **Technique as a Form:** Goku and Vegeta have moved away from generic Super Saiyan forms toward techniques (UI and UE) that reflect their personal philosophies—Goku toward the calm of the Angels and Vegeta toward the destruction of the Gods.
*   **Potential Unlocking:** Characters like Gohan and Piccolo have bypassed divine training by using biological potential (Beast form) or Dragon Ball wishes (Orange Piccolo) to reach the same tier.

## Combat
Dragon Ball Super (DBS) represents a significant evolution in the franchise's combat philosophy. While *Dragon Ball Z* often prioritized raw power levels and "who can scream the loudest," *Super* reintroduces tactical depth, explores divine martial arts, and pushes visual spectacle to new heights.

### 1. Combat & Fighting Styles
The combat in *Super* is defined by a shift from "Mortal Ki" to "God Ki," which emphasizes control and efficiency over sheer output.

*   **Tactical Resurgence:** The series brought back the strategic elements of the original *Dragon Ball*. This is most evident in the **Tournament of Power (TOP)**, where rules (no killing, no flying, ring-out victories) forced characters like Krillin, Master Roshi, and Piccolo to use their brains.
    *   **Master Roshi:** Utilized the *Mafuba* (Evil Containment Wave) and hypnosis to eliminate much stronger foes.
    *   **Android 17:** Became a fan-favorite "MVP" by using his infinite stamina and barrier techniques strategically to protect allies and trap enemies.
*   **Divine Techniques (The "Ultra" Era):**
    *   **Ultra Instinct (Goku):** A defensive, reflexive style where the body moves without conscious thought. It focuses on absolute evasion and precise, "critical hit" counters. It is the pinnacle of "Angel-style" martial arts.
    *   **Ultra Ego (Vegeta):** Introduced in the manga, this is the polar opposite of Ultra Instinct. It is a "Destroyer-style" technique that thrives on aggression. Vegeta intentionally takes damage to fuel his power, converting pain into raw destructive energy.

### 2. Tactical Depth vs. Flashy Spectacle
*Super* balances grounded martial arts with "cosmic-scale" visual effects.
*   **The Spectacle:** The **Dragon Ball Super: Broly** movie is widely considered the franchise's visual peak. It features a 40-minute continuous battle that shifts through multiple art styles—from traditional hand-drawn aesthetics to fluid, high-octane 3D-assisted sequences.
*   **The Choreography:** Unlike the "repeated punch" loops often criticized in the early TV episodes, the later arcs (Goku vs. Jiren, Goku vs. Kefla) featured intricate choreography. A standout moment is Goku’s "sliding Kamehameha" against Kefla, which combined high-speed evasion with a creative use of energy.

### 3. Emotional Stakes
The battles in *Super* often serve as the climax for long-running character arcs.
*   **Future Trunks & The Goku Black Arc:** This arc is the most emotionally heavy in the series. It deals with themes of trauma, loss, and the "indomitable mortal spirit." Trunks’ **Sword of Hope**—fueled by the collective will of the survivors—remains one of the most cathartic moments in the series.
*   **Vegeta’s Growth:** In the TOP, Vegeta’s fight against Toppo (a candidate for God of Destruction) was a battle of ideologies. Toppo cast aside his values for power, while Vegeta doubled down on his pride, his family, and his promise to Cabba, eventually winning through sheer conviction.
*   **The Final Team-Up:** The finale of the anime saw the unthinkable: **Goku and Frieza** fighting side-by-side. The emotional weight came from seeing two mortal enemies put aside decades of hatred to save their universe, ending the series on a note of "grit and determination" rather than just a new transformation.

### 4. Key Battle Comparisons
| Battle | Primary Element | Why it Matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goku vs. Hit** | Tactical | Goku had to "predict the future" to counter Hit’s Time-Skip. |
| **Vegeta vs. Broly** | Spectacle | Showcased the sheer gap between a trained martial artist and a raw "brawler." |
| **Goku/Frieza/17 vs. Jiren** | Emotional/Teamwork | Proved that trust and coordination could overcome a "perfect" individual warrior. |
| **Goku vs. Beerus** | World-Building | Introduced the concept of "God Ki" and the vastness of the multiverse. |

## Recent
As of January 2026, **Dragon Ball Super** is in a transitional period following a long hiatus. While the main storyline has been paused, a major franchise event is scheduled for later this month that is expected to define the series' future.

### **1. Manga Status: The Hiatus and Chapter 104**
The *Dragon Ball Super* manga has been on an indefinite hiatus since **March 2024** (following Chapter 103) due to the passing of series creator Akira Toriyama. 

*   **Latest Chapter (Chapter 104):** After nearly a year of silence, a special chapter titled **"The Birth of Saiyaman X"** was released on **February 19, 2025**. 
    *   **Plot:** This chapter serves as a prequel to the *Super Hero* arc, focusing on Goten and Trunks. It explains their inspiration for becoming the superhero duo Saiyaman X-1 and X-2, influenced by a fictional hero named "Clean God."
    *   **Current State:** Although Chapter 104 ended with a "To Be Continued" teaser, **Chapter 105 has not yet been released.** The manga remains on hiatus as of early January 2026.
*   **Ongoing Arc:** The manga officially concluded the *Super Hero Saga* (an adaptation and expansion of the 2022 movie). The next anticipated storyline is the **Black Frieza Saga**, centered on Frieza’s new "Black" form, which allowed him to effortlessly defeat Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta at the end of the *Granolah the Survivor* arc.

### **2. The "Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri" Event (January 25, 2026)**
The most significant update for fans is the **Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri** (Spirit Bomb Festival), a massive event scheduled for **January 25, 2026**, in Chiba, Japan. This event is being promoted as the "climax" of the franchise's 40th anniversary.
*   **Major Announcements Expected:** Official teasers confirm that Masako Nozawa (Goku's voice actor) and Executive Producer Akio Iyoku will reveal "major new developments."
*   **Rumored Reveals:**
    *   The official return date for the **Dragon Ball Super manga** (Chapter 105).
    *   A new **Dragon Ball Super movie** (rumors suggest two films are currently in production at Toei).
    *   Potential news regarding a **Dragon Ball Super anime remake** or a direct sequel series to the 2018 anime.

### **3. Anime Updates**
*   **Dragon Ball Daima:** This original series, which was Akira Toriyama's final project, served as the primary anime content for 2024–2025. It has concluded its initial run, leaving a vacuum for *Dragon Ball Super* to return.
*   **Super Sequel/Remake Rumors:** There is heavy industry speculation that Toei Animation may announce a remake of the *Dragon Ball Super* anime that follows the manga's continuity more strictly (including the Moro and Granolah arcs) rather than a direct "Season 2." This remains unconfirmed until the January 25 event.

### **4. Summary of Recent Plot Developments**
If you are catching up, here is where the story currently stands in the timeline:
*   **Goku & Vegeta:** Both have achieved "Divine" forms (Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego) but were humbled by Frieza, who trained for 10 years in a Room of Spirit and Time on another planet.
*   **Gohan & Piccolo:** Both reached new tiers of power (*Gohan Beast* and *Orange Piccolo*) during the battle against Cell Max. They are now considered roughly equal to Goku and Vegeta in strength.
*   **Broly:** He is currently training on Beerus’ planet alongside Goku and Vegeta, learning to control his rage so he can fight as a disciplined ally in the upcoming conflict with Frieza.

**Next Major Update:** Watch for news on **January 24/25, 2026**, following the *Genkidamatsuri* event.

## Adaptations
*Dragon Ball Super* (DBS) is unique in the world of anime and manga because, unlike the original *Dragon Ball* series where the anime adapted the manga, both the DBS anime and manga were developed **simultaneously** based on plot outlines provided by the late creator, Akira Toriyama.

Because Toei Animation (anime) and Toyotaro (manga) interpreted these outlines independently, the two versions have significant differences in plot, power scaling, and character development.

### 1. The Three Main "Versions"
*   **The Anime (2015–2018):** Produced by Toei Animation. It ran for 131 episodes and is known for its high-spectacle battles and "filler" episodes that flesh out side characters.
*   **The Manga (2015–Present):** Illustrated by Toyotaro. It is a monthly series that often streamlines the story, focusing more on tactical combat and consistent power scaling. It has continued long after the anime ended.
*   **The Theatrical Movies:** *Battle of Gods*, *Resurrection 'F'*, *Broly*, and *Super Hero*. These are considered the "primary" versions of their respective stories, which the anime and manga then adapt or skip.

---

### 2. Major Arc-by-Arc Differences

| Arc | Anime Version | Manga Version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Battle of Gods** | Extended fight; Goku absorbs "God" power into his base form. | Much shorter; Goku does **not** absorb God power into his base form. |
| **Resurrection 'F'** | Full 13-episode retelling with extra fights (Ginyu returns). | **Skipped entirely.** It is only mentioned in a brief summary. |
| **Universe 6** | Goku uses **SSB + Kaioken** against Hit; Hit improves his Time-Skip mid-fight. | No Kaioken; Goku uses **SSG then SSB** to manage stamina. Hit's power is static. |
| **Future Trunks** | Trunks gains "Super Saiyan Rage" and a Spirit Bomb Sword. | No Rage form; Goku and Vegeta use **"Perfected SSB"** to contain their aura. |
| **Tournament of Power** | Gohan fights Dyspo; Kefla is defeated by Goku (UI). | **Gohan fights Kefla** to a draw; Master Roshi uses a "UI-like" state to dodge Jiren. |
| **Super Hero** | Starts with Dr. Hedo's release; focuses on Piccolo/Gohan. | Includes a **prequel arc** featuring Goten and Trunks as high school superheroes. |

---

### 3. Key Power Scaling & Transformation Changes
The most debated differences involve how the characters' powers work:

*   **Super Saiyan Blue (SSB) Stamina:** In the manga, SSB is a massive drain on stamina. Turning it on and off repeatedly (the "Switch" technique) is a major plot point. In the anime, SSB is used much more frequently with less emphasis on drain.
*   **Kaioken vs. Perfected Blue:** The anime's signature power-up for Goku is **Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken**. This does not exist in the manga. Instead, the manga introduces **Perfected Super Saiyan Blue**, where the user seals their overflowing aura inside their body to maintain 100% power.
*   **Ultra Instinct (UI):** In the anime, UI is a massive power-up triggered by a Spirit Bomb explosion. In the manga, it is treated more as a "state of mind" that Goku learns to apply even to his lower forms (like base or SSG) to improve efficiency.

---

### 4. Manga-Exclusive Content
Since the anime ended in 2018, the manga has produced two major original arcs that have not yet been adapted into an anime series:

*   **Galactic Patrol Prisoner Arc (Moro Arc):** Features an ancient wizard named Moro who eats planets. It focuses on Vegeta training on Planet Yardrat to learn "Spirit Fission" and Goku mastering the UI transformation.
*   **Granolah the Survivor Arc:** Introduces Granolah, who uses a set of Dragon Balls to become the "strongest in the universe" at the cost of his lifespan. This arc debuts Vegeta's **Ultra Ego** form and Goku's **True Ultra Instinct**.

### 5. Which is "Canon"?
Both are considered official continuities. Fans generally view the **manga** as the more "consistent" version of the story because Toyotaro worked directly under Toriyama’s supervision. However, the **anime** is often credited with creating the most iconic moments (like the UI theme and the SSB Kaioken) that defined the series' global popularity. For the full experience, most fans recommend watching the anime for the spectacle and reading the manga for the deeper lore and ongoing story.

## Locations
The world of *Dragon Ball Super* (DBS) significantly expands the series' geography from a single universe to a vast **multiverse** consisting of 12 distinct universes. The setting is defined by celestial realms, diverse alien planets, and high-stakes arenas located outside traditional space-time.

### **1. The Multiverse Structure**
The DBS world is organized into a hierarchy overseen by the **Omni-King, Zeno**.
*   **The 12 Universes:** Originally 18, Zeno destroyed six in a fit of anger. The remaining 12 are "twin universes" (e.g., Universe 7 and Universe 6) that share similar races and planets.
*   **Zeno’s Palace:** The highest point in the multiverse, located far outside the 12 universes. The palace sits atop a giant jellyfish-like structure surrounded by 12 pillars, each representing a universe.
*   **The World of Void:** A realm of infinite nothingness outside the 12 universes, used as the location for the **Tournament of Power**. It has no natural light, time, or space until the Grand Priest constructed the fighting arena there.
*   **Neutral Space:** The area between universes where the **Tournament of Destroyers** (U6 vs. U7) took place on the **Nameless Planet**.

### **2. Universe 7 (The Main Setting)**
Universe 7 is the home of Goku and the Z-Fighters. Its geography is divided into the Living World and the Afterlife.
*   **Earth:** Still the primary hub. Important DBS-specific locations include:
    *   **Monster Island:** A massive wildlife preserve where **Android 17** works as a ranger, protecting rare creatures like the Minotaurus.
    *   **Capsule Corporation:** Expanded in *Super* as a research hub for the Super Dragon Radar and time travel.
    *   **Mount Paozu:** Goku’s home, where he now works as a radish farmer.
*   **Beerus’ Planet:** The home of the God of Destruction, Beerus, and his attendant, Whis. It is a pyramid-shaped landmass floating in a nebula, featuring a giant tree where Beerus sleeps for decades.
*   **New Namek:** The home of the Namekians after the destruction of their original planet. It was a major battleground in the **Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga** against Moro.
*   **Planet Yardrat:** Visited by Vegeta to learn "Spirit Control." It is inhabited by two types of Yardratians (the pink ones from the anime and the small, round ones from the manga).
*   **Planet Cereal:** The setting of the **Granolah the Survivor Saga**. It is a rocky planet formerly inhabited by Cerealians and Namekians, now home to the **Sugarians**, who live in advanced domed cities.
*   **Galactic Patrol HQ & Galactic Prison:** Floating space stations that serve as the base for the Galactic Patrol and a high-security facility for the universe's most dangerous criminals.
*   **Zuno’s Planet:** A planet resembling a giant Chinese temple where the omniscient being **Zuno** resides.

### **3. Universe 6 (The Twin Universe)**
Universe 6 is the mirror of Universe 7 and features several counterparts to familiar locations.
*   **Planet Sadala:** The original homeworld of the Saiyans. Unlike Universe 7, it was never destroyed, and the Saiyans there are a peaceful, heroic race.
*   **Universe 6 Earth:** Originally a desolate wasteland due to war, it was restored by a wish from the Super Dragon Balls so Champa could enjoy Earth's food.
*   **Planet Mayonnai:** A planet mentioned as a source of delicious food for Champa.

### **4. Key Celestial Realms**
*   **Sacred World of the Kai:** A crystalline realm that orbits the main universe. It is the home of the Supreme Kais and is where the Z-Sword was once kept.
*   **The Afterlife:** Includes **King Yemma’s Check-In Station**, **Snake Way**, and **Hell**. In *Super*, Hell is depicted as a "personal" experience, such as Frieza’s hell being a flowery meadow filled with singing angels.
*   **The Demon Realm:** Briefly mentioned and explored further in *Dragon Ball Daima*, this is a chaotic realm at the "bottom" of the universe sphere, ruled by powerful demon kings.

### **5. Geography of the Dragon Balls**
*   **Super Dragon Balls:** These "Wish Orbs" are the size of planets and are scattered between Universes 6 and 7.
*   **Cerealian Dragon Balls:** A unique set of only two small Dragon Balls found on Planet Cereal, created by the Namekian Monaito.

## Arcs
*Dragon Ball Super* is the official canonical sequel to *Dragon Ball Z*, set during the ten-year timeskip between the defeat of Majin Buu (Age 774) and the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament (Age 784). The series follows Goku and Vegeta as they transcend mortal limits to reach the level of the Gods.

### **Dragon Ball Super Timeline & Arc Progression**

The story is divided into several major sagas, some of which were adapted into films before being serialized in the anime and manga.

| Arc Name | Timeline (Age) | Key Power-Ups | Main Antagonist |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **God of Destruction Beerus** | Age 778 | Super Saiyan God | Beerus |
| **Golden Frieza** | Age 779 | Super Saiyan Blue | Golden Frieza |
| **Universe 6 Tournament** | Age 779 | Blue Kaio-ken (Anime) | Hit |
| **"Future" Trunks / Zamasu** | Age 780 | Super Saiyan Rage, Vegito Blue | Fused Zamasu |
| **Universe Survival (ToP)** | Age 780 | Ultra Instinct (-Sign- & Mastered) | Jiren |
| **Broly (Movie/Manga Recap)** | Age 780 | Gogeta Blue | Broly |
| **Galactic Patrol Prisoner** | Age 780–781 | Forced Spirit Fission, UI (at will) | Moro |
| **Granolah the Survivor** | Age 781 | Ultra Ego, True Ultra Instinct | Gas / Black Frieza |
| **Super Hero (Prequel & Movie)** | Age 783 | Orange Piccolo, Gohan Beast | Cell Max |

### **Detailed Arc Summaries**

#### **1. God of Destruction Beerus Saga**
Beerus, the God of Destruction, awakens from a decades-long slumber seeking a "Super Saiyan God." He easily defeats Goku (SSJ3) on King Kai's planet and heads to Earth. Through a ritual involving five other Saiyans, Goku achieves the **Super Saiyan God** form. Though Goku loses the fight, Beerus is impressed enough to spare Earth and takes Goku and Vegeta as students under his attendant, **Whis**.

#### **2. Golden Frieza Saga**
Remnants of Frieza's army use the Dragon Balls to resurrect the tyrant. Frieza trains for four months, achieving his **Golden Frieza** form. Goku and Vegeta return from training with Whis, revealing **Super Saiyan Blue** (SSGSS). Frieza destroys Earth in a last-ditch effort, but Whis rewinds time, allowing Goku to kill Frieza once more.

#### **3. Universe 6 Saga**
Beerus’s brother, Champa (God of Destruction of Universe 6), challenges Beerus to a 5-on-5 tournament. The prize is the **Super Dragon Balls**. Goku and Vegeta encounter new Saiyans (Cabba) and the legendary assassin **Hit**. Goku uses **SSB Kaio-ken** (anime only) to combat Hit’s "Time-Skip." Universe 7 wins, and Beerus uses the wish to restore Universe 6's Earth as a gesture of goodwill.

#### **4. "Future" Trunks / Zamasu Saga**
Future Trunks returns to the past, fleeing an enemy who looks exactly like Goku (**Goku Black**). It is revealed that Black is actually **Zamasu**, a rogue Kaioshin apprentice from Universe 10 who stole Goku’s body in another timeline. He allies with his future self to enact the "Project Zero Mortals." The arc culminates in the fusion of the two Zamasus and their eventual erasure by the future's **Zeno-sama**.

#### **5. Universe Survival Saga (Tournament of Power)**
Zeno organizes a "Tournament of Power" where eight universes compete for survival; losing universes are erased. Universe 7's team includes a resurrected Frieza. Goku reaches the state of the Gods, **Ultra Instinct**, to battle Universe 11's **Jiren**. Android 17 wins the tournament and wishes for all erased universes to be restored.

#### **6. Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga (Moro Arc)**
*Manga Exclusive.* An ancient sorcerer named **Moro** escapes a galactic prison. He has the power to drain the life energy of planets and individuals. Goku trains with the Angel-in-training **Merus** to master Ultra Instinct, while Vegeta travels to Planet Yardrat to learn **Forced Spirit Fission**. Goku eventually defeats Moro by using a giant ki avatar fueled by Uub's divine energy.

#### **7. Granolah the Survivor Saga**
*Manga Exclusive.* **Granolah**, the last survivor of the Cerealian race, uses his planet's Dragon Balls to become the strongest warrior in the universe at the cost of his lifespan. He seeks revenge on the Saiyans and Frieza. During the battle, Vegeta achieves **Ultra Ego**, a form powered by destruction. The true villains, the **Heeters**, wish for their member **Gas** to become even stronger. The arc ends with **Black Frieza** appearing, one-shotting both Goku and Vegeta, and revealing he trained for 10 years in a Room of Spirit and Time.

#### **8. Super Hero Saga**
Set shortly before the end of *Dragon Ball Z*, the Red Ribbon Army returns with **Dr. Hedo** and new androids, **Gamma 1 and 2**. While Goku and Vegeta are off-world training with Broly, Piccolo and Gohan take center stage. Piccolo unlocks **Orange Piccolo**, and Gohan reaches a new level of power called **Gohan Beast** to destroy the rampaging **Cell Max**.

### **Current Status**
The *Dragon Ball Super* manga is currently on hiatus following the passing of creator Akira Toriyama. The latest chapters (101–103) served as an epilogue to the *Super Hero* arc, featuring a sparring match between Ultra Instinct Goku and Beast Gohan. Chapter 104, a special one-shot about Goten and Trunks, was released in February 2025.

## Factions
*Dragon Ball Super* significantly expanded the series' scope from a single planet to a multiverse of 12 universes, each governed by a rigid divine hierarchy and populated by various intergalactic organizations.

### **1. The Divine Hierarchy (The Multiversal Powers)**
The multiverse is governed by a structure that balances creation and destruction.
*   **Zeno (The Omni-King):** The supreme ruler of all 12 universes. He is not a fighter but possesses the power to erase entire universes instantly. There are currently two Zenos (one from the present and one from Future Trunks' timeline).
*   **The Grand Priest:** The father of all Angels and the personal advisor to Zeno. He is one of the top five strongest beings in the multiverse and oversees all divine decrees.
*   **The Angels:** Each universe has an Angel (e.g., **Whis** for U7, **Vados** for U6) who serves as an attendant and teacher to the God of Destruction. They must remain neutral and are constantly in a state of "Ultra Instinct."
*   **Gods of Destruction (GoD):** Beings tasked with destroying planets to maintain the "mortal level" and balance of their universe (e.g., **Beerus**, **Champa**, **Belmod**).
*   **Supreme Kais (Shin-jin):** The "Gods of Creation" who foster life. They are life-linked to their respective God of Destruction; if one dies, the other does as well.

### **2. Major Galactic Organizations & Factions**
#### **The Galactic Patrol (Universe 7)**
A space police force responsible for maintaining order in the Milky Way.
*   **Leader:** The Galactic King.
*   **Key Members:** **Jaco** (the series' recurring comedic elite) and **Merus** (a top-tier agent later revealed to be an Angel-in-training).
*   **Role:** They handle galactic criminals but are often outmatched by high-level threats like Frieza or Moro, requiring them to "deputize" the Z-Fighters.

#### **The Frieza Force**
A massive imperialist army that conquers and sells planets.
*   **Leader:** **Frieza** (revived and now stronger than ever with his "Black Frieza" form).
*   **Status:** After the Tournament of Power, Frieza fully rebuilt his empire. It now includes new recruits like **Cheelai** and **Lemo**, and has integrated remnants of the Saiyan race (Broly).

#### **The Heeters (Manga Only)**
A criminal "broker" organization that operates in the shadows of the Frieza Force.
*   **Members:** **Elec** (Leader/Strategist), **Gas** (Enforcer), **Maki**, and **Oil**.
*   **Business Model:** They are "planet brokers" who find buyers for the worlds Frieza conquers. Their true goal is to amass enough intel and money to eventually usurp Frieza and rule the universe.

#### **The Pride Troopers (Universe 11)**
A "Super Sentai" style hero team that maintains peace in Universe 11.
*   **Key Members:** **Jiren** (the strongest mortal), **Toppo** (leader and GoD candidate), and **Dyspo**.
*   **Role:** Unlike the Z-Fighters, they are an official, highly organized public force with dozens of members and specialized uniforms.

#### **The Sadala Defense Forces (Universe 6)**
The official military of the Saiyan homeworld, Planet Sadala.
*   **Key Members:** **Cabba** and his mentor **Renso**.
*   **Role:** Unlike the Universe 7 Saiyans, these Saiyans are "heroes for hire" who protect planets from invaders.

### **3. Earth-Based Factions**
*   **The Z-Fighters (The Dragon Team):** An informal alliance of Earth's strongest warriors (Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, etc.). In *Super*, they are often called upon by deities or the Galactic Patrol to handle multiversal threats.
*   **The Red Ribbon Army (Reformed):** Featured in *Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero*. Led by **Magenta** (son of Commander Red) under the front of "Red Pharmaceuticals." They recruited **Dr. Hedo** to create the **Gamma Androids** and **Cell Max** to seek revenge on Capsule Corp.

### **4. Major Enemies & Antagonists**
| Faction/Enemy | Arc | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goku Black & Zamasu** | Future Trunks Arc | The "Project Zero Mortals" (eradicating all mortal life). |
| **Tournament of Power Teams** | Universe Survival Arc | Survival (avoiding erasure by Zeno). |
| **Moro's Corps** | Galactic Patrol Prisoner Arc | Consuming the life force of planets to achieve eternal youth. |
| **Granolah** | Granolah the Survivor Arc | Revenge against the Saiyans and Frieza for the destruction of the Cerealians. |
| **Cell Max** | Super Hero Arc | Pure destructive rampaging (uncontrolled bio-android). |

## Tone
*Dragon Ball Super* (DBS) represents a significant tonal shift in the franchise, blending the high-stakes action of *Dragon Ball Z* with the whimsical, gag-heavy roots of the original *Dragon Ball*. 

### **1. Tone: The "Modernized" Balance**
The overall tone of *Dragon Ball Super* is **more lighthearted and laid-back** than its predecessor, *Dragon Ball Z*. While *DBZ* was defined by a sense of mounting dread and "gritty" survival, *Super* often feels like a celebration of the characters' lives after their greatest struggles.
*   **Juxtaposition:** The series frequently places god-tier threats alongside mundane activities. For example, the God of Destruction, Beerus, is introduced as a terrifying planet-killer but quickly becomes a comedic foil obsessed with Earth's cuisine.
*   **Arc Variation:** The tone varies significantly by arc. The *Battle of Gods* and *Universe 6* arcs are largely adventurous and comedic, while the *Future Trunks (Goku Black)* arc is notably darker and more somber.

### **2. Themes: Growth and Redemption**
*   **Overcoming Limits:** A core theme is the "origin of power." Unlike *DBZ*, which focused on "Super Saiyan" as a biological milestone, *Super* explores the mental and spiritual aspects of power through forms like **Ultra Instinct** (calmness) and **Ultra Ego** (indulgence).
*   **Redemption:** The series continues the franchise's theme that no one is beyond saving. This is most evident in the return of **Frieza**, who remains a villain but is forced into a reluctant, often darkly comedic alliance with the heroes.
*   **Returning to Roots:** Many arcs emphasize "remembering your beginnings." Master Roshi’s participation in the Tournament of Power serves as a reminder that martial arts is about more than just raw power levels—it's about technique and wisdom.

### **3. Dark Comedy: Sadistic Wit and Absurdity**
*Dragon Ball Super* utilizes dark comedy primarily through its villains and the nonchalant attitudes of its divine characters.
*   **Frieza’s Sadism:** Much of the "dark" humor comes from Frieza's polite yet murderous demeanor. During the Tournament of Power, his "accidental" brutality towards weaker opponents is played for laughs.
*   **Divine Indifference:** The "Zeno" (Lords of Everything) are child-like beings who erase entire universes with the casualness of a game. The dark comedy lies in the Z-Fighters' terror as they try to keep these "toddler gods" entertained to avoid extinction.
*   **Absurdist Humor:** Moments like Vegeta performing a "Bingo Dance" to appease Beerus or Goku accidentally teleporting into Bulma’s bedroom are examples of the series using "disrespectful" humor to undercut serious moments.

### **4. Optimism and Atmosphere**
Despite the threat of "Universal Erasure," the atmosphere of *Super* remains fundamentally **optimistic**.
*   **The "HOPE" Motif:** This is most prominent in the *Future Trunks* arc. Trunks’ time machine has "HOPE!!" written on it, symbolizing the resilience of mortals against seemingly invincible gods.
*   **Family and Community:** The series spends significant time on "slice-of-life" episodes (e.g., the baseball game, Pan’s birth). This creates a warm, communal atmosphere that makes the stakes feel personal rather than just abstractly "universal."

### **5. Genre and Mood**
*   **Genre:** Adventure, Martial Arts, and **Fantasy Comedy**. While it remains a "Shonen" battle series, the "Comedy" tag is more earned here than in *DBZ*.
*   **Mood:** The mood is often **vibrant and energetic**, supported by a digital art style that uses brighter color palettes than the hand-drawn, shadowed look of the 90s. 
*   **The "Tournament" Mood:** The final arc (Tournament of Power) creates a "festival" mood—a grand exhibition of power where the tension is balanced by the spectacle of seeing dozens of unique warriors from different universes.
