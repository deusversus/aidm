  name: Alchemy and Alkahestry
  mechanics: 'A metaphysical science of manipulating matter through three stages:
    Comprehension (understanding molecular structure), Deconstruction (breaking matter
    down), and Reconstruction (reshaping into a new form). It is governed by the Law
    of Equivalent Exchange, requiring conservation of mass and natural providence.
    Amestrian Alchemy uses tectonic energy, while Xingese Alkahestry utilizes the
    ''Dragon’s Pulse'' for healing and long-distance transmutation.'
  limitations: Strict adherence to Equivalent Exchange; matter cannot be created from
    nothing. The 'Human Taboo' prevents soul/life creation. Most practitioners require
    physical transmutation circles. Errors or insufficient materials cause 'rebounds'
    (physical injury). Human transmutation attempts result in a 'toll' taken by Truth,
    often involving the loss of body parts or functions.
  tiers:
  - God-Like (Living Philosopher's Stones like Father and Hohenheim)
  - The Homunculi (Beings with unique abilities and regeneration via internal stones)
  - Circle-less Alchemists (Those who have seen the Truth and can transmute by clapping)
  - State Alchemists (Elite military-certified specialists with the rank of Major)
  - Civilian Alchemists (Standard practitioners using alchemy for research or construction)
