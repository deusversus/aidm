  name: Plant-based Energy / Gate Mechanics
  mechanics: Plants act as biological 'Gates' or conduits to a higher dimension, producing
    energy by manipulating causality and matter at a quantum level. Sentient 'Independents'
    can consciously tap into this Gate to manifest physical phenomena such as the
    Angel Arm (energy cannon), spatial manipulation (Black Hole and Subspace Bullets),
    matter creation (Angel Wings), and telepathic communication. Humans can bridge
    this gap through 'Eye of Michael' modifications, using Plant-based cells and cybernetics
    to gain superhuman strength and regeneration.
  limitations: A Plant's energy is finite, represented by the 'Black Hair Phenomenon'
    where hair turns black as life force is depleted; reaching the 'Final Run' results
    in death. Human modifications cause accelerated aging and a dependency on specialized
    regenerative drugs to heal fatal wounds.
