  name: Beast King Authority and Arcanacite Sorcery
  mechanics: Powers stem from the elemental authority of the Four Beast Kings and
    the utilization of Arcanacite crystals. Humans utilize Manahydrite to bypass supernatural
    defenses, while weapons can evolve via Soul Absorption. The Forge of Hiden creates
    Forge Kings through a revival process that binds them to its directives.
  limitations: Beast Kings lose significant power in human forms. Magic requires specific
    catalysts or exacts physical tolls. Undead beings are magically tethered to their
    creators and require biological patching with monster parts for repairs. Manahydrite
    is extremely rare and the only material capable of harming high-tier beasts.
