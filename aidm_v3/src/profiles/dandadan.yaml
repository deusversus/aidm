  name: Spiritual and Extraterrestrial Fusion
  mechanics: A hybrid system where humans host Yokai auras for physical transformation,
    utilize Nanoskin technology that responds to imagination, and employ Kotodama
    to manifest spoken words into reality through conviction.
  limitations: Usage is restricted by the 'All Out' limit (twice-daily maximum for
    high speed), extreme physical exhaustion, the necessity for mental clarity to
    maintain technology, and the requirement of physical anchors for spirits.
  tiers:
  - Physical Conditioning
  - Spiritual Mastery
  - Top-tier (Evil Eye/Okarun)

  character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower and instinct,
  not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
