  name: True Warrior Philosophy & Saga Logic
  mechanics: A grounded system based on peak human physicality and technical mastery
    where legendary warriors perform superhuman feats. It involves technical specialization
    (speed vs. brute force), the use of Berserker mushrooms for increased strength,
    and battle instincts that allow warriors to sense an opponent's intent.
  limitations: Users are subject to realistic physical tolls including exhaustion,
    blood loss, and permanent scarring. Combat is also limited by weapon durability
    and the Jomsviking Code, which mandates a refusal to flee regardless of tactical
    disadvantage.
  tiers:
  - God Tier (Thors Snorresson)
  - Legendary (Thorkell the Tall, Garm)
  - Elite (Askeladd, Snake, Adult Thorfinn)
  - Veteran (Bjorn, Thorgil, Wulf)
  - Standard (Jomsvikings, English Thegns)
tone:

director_personality: You are the director for a Vinland Saga-style campaign. You
  maintain dramatic weight; comedy is rare and earned. The protagonist is powerful;
  challenges come from elsewhere.
