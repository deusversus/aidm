## Locations
*Fate/strange Fake* is set in the fictional city of **Snowfield, Nevada**, a location specifically engineered by a U.S.-based organization of magi to host a "False" Holy Grail War as a primer for a "True" one. The geography is intentionally artificial, designed to mimic the spiritual properties of Fuyuki City, Japan.

### **1. Geography & Setting Overview**
Snowfield is located north of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. It is described as a **"Crenel"**—a city emerging from the wilderness with "harmonized borders" where the artificial and natural are forced into a strange balance. 

*   **Construction:** The city was built using soil and materials transported from Fuyuki to replicate its spiritual leylines.
*   **The "Black Pedestal":** Conceptually, the city acts as a "tuner of nature," a central point that balances the four extreme and uncharacteristic environments surrounding it.
*   **Concealment Magecraft:** The city's foundations are imbued with suggestion-based magecraft that causes ordinary citizens to ignore or rationalize magical phenomena, allowing the war to escalate with minimal public interference.

---

### **2. The Four Cardinal Regions**
The city is surrounded by four distinct environmental zones that are geographically impossible for the Nevada desert, created through magecraft to serve as ritual boundaries.

| Region | Description | Key Characters/Events |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **North (Ravines)** | Giant, deep ravines and canyons reminiscent of the Grand Canyon. | Used as a gathering point for the "United Front" of Masters and Servants. |
| **South (Desert)** | A vast, arid, and traditional desert wasteland. | The site of the initial clash between Gilgamesh and Enkidu. |
| **West (Forest)** | A thick, lush forest that is uncharacteristic of the dry Nevada climate. | Location of a mansion used by Haruri Borzak (True Berserker's Master) and Ishtar. |
| **East (Marsh)** | A swampy, marshy area. | Associated with Sigma (Watcher's Master) and the summoning of True Lancer. |

---

### **3. Key Districts and Landmarks**
The urban center of Snowfield contains several critical locations where the 13 Masters and Servants operate.

*   **Snowerk District:** The central metropolitan area. It houses the **Crystal Hill City Hotel**, the tallest building in Snowfield. In the later stages of the war, Enkidu uses the top of this building to anchor his Noble Phantasm, *Enuma Elish*.
*   **Snowfield Opera House:** A partially collapsed building in the city center. It serves as the base for **Ayaka Sajou** and **Saber (Richard I)**. The opera house is spiritually significant, as Richard I considers "Art" to be the highest form of summoning.
*   **Snowfield Police Department (SFPD):** The headquarters of Police Chief **Orlando Reeve**. He leads **Clan Calatin**, a specialized police force of 28 members who act as a collective "Master" for False Caster (Alexandre Dumas).
*   **Snowfield General Hospital:** A major medical facility where **Tsubaki Kuruoka** (Master of False Rider/Pale Rider) is kept in a magically induced coma. The hospital becomes a "silent zone" under the influence of Pale Rider’s pestilence.
*   **Main Street:** The site of the legendary first battle between **Gilgamesh** and **Enkidu**, which nearly leveled the city and alerted the Mage's Association in London to the war's scale.
*   **Neo-Ishtar Temple:** A divine structure manifested by the goddess **Ishtar** (possessing the homunculus Philia). It is eventually treated as a "Singularity" or a separate world cut off from the rest of the planet.

---

### **4. Strategic & Ritual Locations**
*   **The Leylines:** The city sits on a powerful spiritual junction. The "False" Holy Grail War was designed to "prime" these leylines, exciting them enough to trigger the summoning of the "True" Servants.
*   **The Greater Grail:** Unlike the Fuyuki Grail hidden in a cave, the Snowfield Grail's location is tied to the city's very existence, with the "False" Grail acting as a battery for the "True" ritual.
*   **Operation Aurora Fall:** A contingency plan by the U.S. government. If the Holy Grail War cannot be contained or if the "Mystery" is revealed to the world, the military is prepared to nuke Snowfield to erase all evidence of magecraft.

## Combat
*Fate/strange Fake* (FSF) is renowned for having the most "broken" and high-scale combat in the *Fate* franchise. Written by Ryohgo Narita (*Baccano!*, *Durarara!!*), the series features a "True and False" Holy Grail War in Snowfield, Nevada, involving 13–14 Servants. This setup creates a unique blend of tactical depth, deep emotional stakes, and overwhelming visual spectacle.

### **1. Combat Fighting Styles**
The fighting styles in FSF are defined by the "True vs. False" dynamic, where many Servants are irregular or conceptual entities.

*   **The Speedster (Richard the Lionheart - Saber):** Richard’s style revolves around extreme speed and the ability to use **any object** he holds (from a tree branch to a stolen sword) as a catalyst for an "Excalibur" blast. He can also manifest the "shadows" of his past allies to fight alongside him.
*   **The Conceptual Horror (Pale Rider - False Rider):** This Servant is the literal concept of **Pestilence**. It doesn't fight with a sword but by spreading a dream-world disease that can manifest the fears of its victims or act as a sentient plague that bypasses traditional defenses.
*   **The Corrupted Powerhouse (Alcides - True Archer/Avenger):** A version of Heracles who has rejected his divinity. He uses a massive bow and the **King’s Order** Noble Phantasm, which allows him to use the tools and beasts from his Twelve Labors (e.g., the Nemean Lion’s pelt for invulnerability).
*   **The Shadow Stalker (Hassan of the Fathomless Rift - True Assassin):** Unlike traditional Hassans, he is a "shadow of death" who can merge with and warp through any shadow. He can kill targets by inducing strokes or heart attacks, making him a terrifying tactical threat.
*   **The Primordial Mecha (Huwawa - True Berserker):** A giant, mecha-like beast that emits "calamities" (earthquakes, floods) through a halo. It is a physical force of nature that requires multiple Servants to hold back.

### **2. Tactical Depth**
Because the power levels are so high, battles are rarely simple duels; they are complex, multi-factional chess matches.

*   **Human vs. Hero (Clan Calatin):** Police Chief Orlando Reeve uses **False Caster (Alexandre Dumas)** to create mass-produced imitations of Noble Phantasms. He arms his elite police force (Clan Calatin) with these, attempting to prove that modern humans can defeat ancient legends through technology and teamwork.
*   **Strategic Alliances:** The war is a "free-for-all" where enemies frequently team up to handle "out-of-context" threats. For example, **Richard (Saber)** and **No Name Assassin** form a truce to survive the onslaught of **True Berserker**.
*   **Counter-Play:** Tactics often involve specific counters, such as using **Enkidu’s** connection to the earth to track **True Assassin** through the shadows, or **Gilgamesh** being forced to use **Ea** immediately because he recognizes his opponents as genuine threats rather than "mongrels."

### **3. Emotional Stakes**
Narita weaves personal tragedy into the chaos, ensuring the flashy battles have weight.

*   **Tiné Chelc & Gilgamesh:** Tiné is a young indigenous girl fighting to reclaim her land. Her relationship with Gilgamesh is one of mutual respect; he views her not as a tool, but as a "subject" to be protected and guided, which drives him to fight more seriously than in *Fate/stay night*.
*   **Tsubaki Kuruoka:** A comatose child who is the Master of **Pale Rider**. Her "battles" take place in a dream world where she just wants to be happy, unaware that her Servant is devouring the city to protect her.
*   **The Zealot (False Assassin):** A candidate for the title of Hassan who was rejected for being *too* talented. Her fighting style is a frantic, emotional display of every single "Zabaniya" technique from past Hassans, fueled by her religious fervor and resentment.

### **4. Flashy Spectacle**
The series is designed as "pure fanservice" for the Nasuverse, featuring battles that reshape the landscape.

*   **Gilgamesh vs. Enkidu:** Their opening clash in the desert is legendary. It involves thousands of weapons from the **Gate of Babylon** colliding with Enkidu’s ability to shape the earth itself into spears. The resulting shockwaves create massive craters and draw the attention of every participant in the city.
*   **Ishtar’s Arrival:** The goddess Ishtar manifests and attempts to drop the **Bull of Heaven (Gugalanna)** on Snowfield, a feat of such scale that it forces the U.S. government to consider nuking the city to contain the magical fallout.
*   **Animation (A-1 Pictures):** The *Whispers of Dawn* special and the upcoming series utilize high-budget, fluid animation to capture the "visual overload" of Noble Phantasms, using vibrant colors and cinematic lighting to emphasize the god-like power of the combatants.

## Tone
*Fate/strange Fake*, written by **Ryohgo Narita** (author of *Baccano!* and *Durarara!!*), is a unique entry in the *Fate* franchise. Originally conceived as an April Fools' joke titled *Fake/states night*, it evolved into a full light novel and manga series. It is defined by its massive ensemble cast, "rule of cool" logic, and a distinct departure from the somber tragedy of *Fate/Zero*.

### **1. Tone: The "B-Movie" Spectacle**
The tone of *Fate/strange Fake* is often described by Narita himself as a **"B-side movie you watch while eating popcorn."** Unlike the philosophical weight of *Fate/stay night* or the crushing nihilism of *Fate/Zero*, *Strange Fake* leans into high-octane, blockbuster energy. It is fast-paced, loud, and intentionally "extra."
*   **Chaotic & Over-the-Top:** The series features some of the most powerful Servants in the franchise (e.g., Gilgamesh and Enkidu fighting at full power) and treats their world-shaking clashes with a sense of awe rather than just dread.
*   **Meta-Commentary:** Because it started as a "fake" story, the tone often winks at the audience, playing with *Fate* tropes and subverting expectations about how a Holy Grail War "should" function.

### **2. Themes: Heroism and the "Fake"**
*   **The Nature of a "Hero":** Because the ritual is a "fake" copy, the definition of a "Heroic Spirit" is blurred. The story explores what happens when concepts (like a plague), urban legends (Jack the Ripper), or even non-human entities are summoned as "heroes."
*   **Truth vs. Falsity:** The central conflict revolves around a "False" Grail War being used to mask a "True" one. This theme extends to the characters, many of whom are liars, imposters, or individuals struggling with their own identities.
*   **Concealment of Mystery:** A recurring theme in the *Nasuverse* (the shared universe of *Fate*), this series emphasizes the struggle to keep magic hidden from the modern world, especially when the war takes place in a public American city like Snowfield.

### **3. Dark Comedy: Narita’s Signature Style**
Narita is a master of **dark comedy**, and *Strange Fake* is filled with it. The humor often arises from the absurdity of the situations or the "batshit insane" personalities of the Masters and Servants.
*   **Absurdist Interactions:** For example, the Berserker-class Jack the Ripper is not a bloodthirsty monster but a polite, shape-shifting entity that often acts as a "straight man" to his eccentric Master, Flat Escardos.
*   **Violent Irony:** Death and danger are ever-present, but they are often punctuated by witty dialogue or bizarre coincidences, preventing the story from feeling purely grim.

### **4. Optimism: High-Energy vs. Tragedy**
While traditional *Fate* stories often end in "bittersweet" or "tragic" outcomes, *Strange Fake* maintains a surprising level of **optimism**. 
*   **The "Fun" Factor:** The narrative prioritizes the excitement of the "impossible" happening. Even in dire situations, characters like Flat Escardos approach the war with a sense of wonder and a desire to "make friends" with Servants, injecting a lighthearted hope into the ritual.
*   **Resilience:** The optimism stems from the characters' refusal to be bound by the "rules" of the Grail War. They constantly find creative, often ridiculous ways to survive and thrive.

### **5. Atmosphere: Urban Mystery & "Mad Saga"**
The atmosphere is a blend of **modern American urbanism** and **ancient mythic grandeur**. 
*   **Snowfield, Nevada:** The setting—a man-made city in the middle of a desert—creates an "uncanny valley" vibe. It feels like a stage set specifically for a massacre, giving the story a localized, high-stakes pressure cooker feel.
*   **The "Mad Saga":** Official marketing calls it a "mad saga of furious struggle." The atmosphere is thick with conspiracy; every character has a secret agenda, and the city itself feels like it’s hiding something.

### **6. Genre & Mood**
*   **Genre:** Urban Fantasy, Mystery, Battle Royale, Action-Thriller.
*   **Mood:** **Exhilarating and Suspenseful.** The mood shifts rapidly between the tension of a high-stakes investigation and the adrenaline of a god-tier battle. It captures the feeling of a "festival of heroes" where the stakes are the end of the world, but the participants are having too much "fun" to stop.

### **Comparison Summary**
| Feature | *Fate/Zero* | *Fate/strange Fake* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Tone** | Tragic, Nihilistic | Chaotic, High-Energy |
| **Humor** | Rare, Dark | Frequent, Absurdist |
| **Protagonist** | Clear (Kiritsugu) | Ensemble (No clear lead) |
| **Power Scale** | Grounded/Tactical | "Broken"/Overpowered |
| **Ending Vibe** | Inevitable Doom | Unpredictable Spectacle |

## Characters
*Fate/strange Fake*, written by Ryōgo Narita (author of *Durarara!!* and *Baccano!*), is set in Snowfield, Nevada, several years after the Fifth Holy Grail War. The story is unique for its "ensemble cast" structure and the simultaneous occurrence of two separate but overlapping rituals: the **False Holy Grail War** and the **True Holy Grail War**.

### **The Core Conflict: True vs. False War**
The ritual was orchestrated by a U.S. government-backed organization and the magus **Francesca Prelati** to recreate the Fuyuki Grail.
*   **The False War:** Initially summoned 6 Servants (missing the Saber class) to "prime" the land with mana.
*   **The True War:** Once the land was primed, a second set of 7 "True" Servants was summoned.
*   **The Result:** A chaotic 13-Servant "True and False Holy Grail War" where the lines between factions are blurred.

---

### **Main Protagonists**
While the series is an ensemble, two characters serve as the primary "viewpoint" protagonists:

#### **1. Ayaka Sajyou & Saber (Richard I)**
*   **Ayaka's Role:** A mysterious, introverted girl who arrives in Snowfield with no memory of why she is there. She is linked to an urban legend in Fuyuki ("Person A") involving a family tragedy.
*   **Saber’s Identity:** **Richard I (The Lionheart)**. He is a "True" Servant who manifested without a proper Master, eventually contracting with Ayaka.
*   **Abilities:** Richard can use any object he holds as "Excalibur" (though at a lower power) and can summon the "Rounds of Lionheart"—shadowy manifestations of his former comrades.
*   **Relationship:** They share a protective, almost knightly bond. Richard is fascinated by modern culture, while Ayaka provides the moral grounding for his heroics.

#### **2. Sigma & Watcher**
*   **Sigma's Role:** A nameless mercenary and the "child" of Maiya Hisau (from *Fate/Zero*). He was hired as a "wild card" Master.
*   **Watcher’s Identity:** An irregular class. Watcher does not fight directly but manifests as "shadows" of other Heroic Spirits (like a version of Asclepius or a young Captain Nemo) to guide Sigma.
*   **Abilities:** Sigma is a highly skilled combatant but lacks "Mystery." Watcher’s role is to put Sigma through "trials" so he can become a **"True Lancer"** while still alive.
*   **Relationship:** A teacher-student dynamic where Watcher is often cryptic and demanding, pushing Sigma toward a metamorphosis.

---

### **Key Antagonists & Masterminds**

#### **1. Francesca Prelati & True Caster (François Prelati)**
*   **Role:** The primary chaotic mastermind. Francesca is a reincarnating magus who has lived for centuries.
*   **Relationship:** She summoned **François Prelati**, who is essentially a past version of herself. They share a twisted, self-obsessed bond and participate in the war purely for "entertainment."
*   **Abilities:** They specialize in illusions and psychological horror, using the *Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine* (a spellbook similar to the one used by Gilles de Rais in *Fate/Zero*).

#### **2. Ishtar (Possessing Philia)**
*   **Role:** A major antagonistic force. The Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar possessed the body of an Einzbern homunculus (Philia).
*   **Motivation:** She despises Gilgamesh and Enkidu and seeks to ruin the war for her own amusement.
*   **Abilities:** She possesses divine authority, can manipulate the "Bull of Heaven" (Gugalanna), and can shut down other Servants' abilities.

#### **3. Faldeus Dioland & True Assassin**
*   **Role:** A high-ranking official in the U.S. government’s secret magecraft division. He is a "nationalist" antagonist who wants to secure the Grail for the United States.
*   **Servant:** **Hassan-i-Sabbah** (the "True" Assassin).

### **Other Major Characters & Relationships**

| Character Pair | Servant Identity | Roles & Abilities | Relationship |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tiné Chelc & False Archer** | **Gilgamesh** | Tiné is a young mage from the indigenous tribe of Snowfield. Gilgamesh uses his *Gate of Babylon*. | Gilgamesh treats Tiné like a young subject/protégé, showing a more "kingly" and protective side. |
| **Silver Wolf & False Lancer** | **Enkidu** | The Master is a literal wolf chimera. Enkidu uses *Age of Babylon* (creating weapons from the earth). | Enkidu views the wolf as a pure soul and protects it fiercely. |
| **Flat Escardos & False Berserker** | **Jack the Ripper** | Flat is a genius student of Lord El-Melloi II. Jack is a conceptual entity that can "become anyone." | A comedic but powerful duo. Flat’s chaotic genius perfectly matches Jack’s unpredictable nature. |
| **Bazdilot Cordelion & True Archer** | **Alcides (Heracles)** | Bazdilot is a cold-blooded mob magus. He used Grail mud to corrupt Heracles, stripping his divinity. | A purely transactional, dark relationship. Alcides is a vengeful monster who hates humans and gods alike. |
| **Tsubaki Kuruoka & False Rider** | **Pale Rider** | Tsubaki is a young girl in a coma. Pale Rider is the Horseman of Pestilence (a concept of disease). | Pale Rider acts as a "guardian" for Tsubaki, manifesting her dreams into a lethal reality that consumes the city. |

### **Key Relationships to Know**
*   **Gilgamesh & Enkidu:** Their reunion is the "trigger" that escalates the war. They are eternal rivals and best friends whose initial clash was so powerful it reshaped the Nevada desert.
*   **Flat & Lord El-Melloi II:** Flat is the "star pupil" of Waver Velvet. His participation brings the Mage's Association's attention (and anxiety) to Snowfield.
*   **The Police (Clan Calatin):** Led by **Orlando Reeve** (Master of False Caster/Alexandre Dumas), this is a 28-man police squad armed with mass-produced Noble Phantasms, representing the "modern" approach to the Grail War.

## Factions
*Fate/strange Fake* features one of the most complex and multi-layered faction systems in the *Fate* franchise. Unlike traditional Holy Grail Wars involving seven pairs, this "Fake" war in Snowfield, Nevada, escalates into a massive conflict involving world governments, ancient magi, and multiple secret organizations.

### **1. The Masterminds: The US Government & Faldeus’s Organization**
The war was orchestrated by a clandestine branch of the **United States Government** in collaboration with rogue magi to replicate the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.
*   **Faldeus Dioland:** A high-ranking official and magus who acted as a spy within the Mages' Association (Clock Tower) to steal data. He is the primary strategist for the American side.
*   **Francesca Prelati:** An ancient, chaotic magus (an incarnation of the historical François Prelati) who provided the technical knowledge to build the Snowfield ritual. She views the war as a grand "game."
*   **Goal:** To analyze the "Third Magic" and create a wish-granting engine under American control, independent of European oversight.

### **2. The Snowfield Administration: Police & Clan Calatin**
The city of Snowfield itself is a "stage" where the local administration is fully aware of the supernatural conflict.
*   **Orlando Reeve:** The Police Chief of Snowfield and a Master. He despises the "mystery" of traditional magi and wants to prove that modern human technology and organization can surpass ancient heroes.
*   **Clan Calatin:** An elite squad of twenty-eight magi police officers. Under the guidance of **False Caster (Alexandre Dumas)**, they are equipped with mass-produced "mimicries" of Noble Phantasms, allowing ordinary humans to fight Servants.

### **3. The Traditional Powers: Mages' Association & Holy Church**
Both organizations sent representatives to investigate and contain the "heretical" American ritual.
*   **The Mages' Association (Clock Tower):** Sent the investigator **Langal** to Snowfield. **Lord El-Melloi II** is also deeply involved from London, as his student **Flat Escardos** traveled to Snowfield and accidentally became a Master.
*   **The Holy Church:** Sent **Hansa Cervantes**, a cyborg priest and powerful Executor from the Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament, to act as the "official" moderator. However, Hansa often acts as a one-man army to eliminate threats to the public.

### **4. The Indigenous Faction: Protectors of the Land**
Before Snowfield was built, the land belonged to an indigenous tribe that guarded its leylines for over a thousand years.
*   **Tiné Chelc:** The young leader of the tribe and Master of **False Archer (Gilgamesh)**. 
*   **Goal:** To reclaim their sacred land from the US government and the magi who "stole" it to build the city. They are the only faction with a legitimate ancestral claim to the territory.

### **5. The Underworld: The Scladio Family**
A powerful American mafia organization with deep ties to the US government and the magical world.
*   **Galvarosso Scladio:** The head of the family, who wields enough political power to influence federal decisions.
*   **Bazdilot Cordelion:** A ruthless hitman for the family and Master of **True Archer (Alcides/Heracles)**. He represents the "dark side" of the war, using extreme violence and corruption to achieve victory.

### **6. The "True" vs. "False" Servant Alliances**
The war is split into two simultaneous rituals: the **False Holy Grail War** (6 Servants) and the **True Holy Grail War** (7 Servants).
*   **The Gilgamesh-Enkidu Alliance:** Unlike other wars where they might fight, **Gilgamesh (False Archer)** and **Enkidu (False Lancer)** recognize each other immediately. Their "battle" is more of a reunion, and they occasionally act as a neutral power block that no other faction dares to touch.
*   **The Sigma/Watcher Faction:** **Sigma**, a nameless mercenary hired by Francesca, summoned the unique **Watcher** class. This faction is a "wild card," as Watcher’s goal is to transform Sigma into a "True Lancer" while he is still alive.
*   **The Ayaka/Richard Faction:** **Ayaka Sajyou** and **Saber (Richard the Lionheart)** are the "protagonist" duo, often caught between the machinations of larger organizations while trying to protect civilians.

### **7. External Observers & Threats**
*   **The Dead Apostle Ancestors:** Several high-ranking vampires are watching the war. **Jester Karture** (a Master) is a Dead Apostle, while **Van-Fem** and **Caubac Alcatraz** observe from the sidelines.
*   **Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg:** The Wizard Marshall of the Second Magic monitors the Snowfield timeline, fearing it may lead to a "Type" (Ultimate One) level threat.
*   **Thia Escardos:** An emerging "Prime Species" born from the body of Flat Escardos. Thia is considered a threat to the Human Order, prompting the **Counter Force** to intervene.

## Power System
The power system in *Fate/strange Fake* (FsF) is one of the most complex and "broken" in the *Fate* franchise. It is defined by a flawed, dual-ritual system that intentionally breaks the established rules of the Fuyuki Holy Grail War to create a "strange" and "fake" conflict in Snowfield, USA.

### 1. Core Mechanics: The Dual Ritual
Unlike standard wars, FsF features two simultaneous, overlapping rituals:
*   **The False Holy Grail War:** A "primer" ritual designed by an American organization (led by Faldeus Dioland) and the magus Francesca Prelati. It summons **six "False" Servants** (Archer, Lancer, Rider, Caster, Assassin, Berserker). The Saber class is intentionally omitted because the ritual is a flawed copy of the Third Fuyuki War.
*   **The True Holy Grail War:** Once the False Servants agitate the leylines with their summoning and combat, the "True" ritual activates, summoning **seven "True" Servants** (including a Saber).
*   **The Result:** 13 Master-Servant pairs fighting at once, blurring the lines between "True" and "False" legitimacy.

### 2. Servant Abilities & Unique Classes
The power scaling in FsF is significantly higher than in *Fate/stay night* or *Fate/Zero*.
*   **Irregular Classes:**
    *   **Watcher:** A class that does not fight directly but observes and provides "trials" to its Master (Sigma) to facilitate his evolution.
    *   **False Rider (Pale Rider):** Not a Heroic Spirit, but the **concept of Pestilence** (one of the Four Horsemen). It has no physical form and operates as a sentient virus/world-ending phenomenon.
*   **Broken Noble Phantasms (NPs):**
    *   **Alcides (Heracles Alter):** Uses *King’s Order* to access 12 separate Noble Phantasms (one for each Labor) and *Reincarnation Pandora* to **steal** the Noble Phantasms of other Servants.
    *   **Richard I (True Saber):** Can turn any object he holds (even a tree branch) into a "pseudo-Excalibur" and materializes the shadows of his past allies to fight alongside him.
    *   **Alexandre Dumas (False Caster):** His NP, *Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine*, allows him to "revise" ordinary objects into pseudo-Noble Phantasms, arming entire squads of humans with high-tier weaponry.

### 3. Master Systems & Organizations
*   **Clan Calatin:** A 28-member elite police force in Snowfield. They are non-magi armed with Dumas’s "revised" Noble Phantasms, allowing ordinary humans to combat Servants.
*   **Tiné Chelc:** A Master whose magecraft is tied directly to the **Snowfield leylines**, giving her a near-infinite mana supply to support Gilgamesh.
*   **The American Government:** Unlike the secretive Mages' Association, the US government is actively involved, using satellite surveillance and black-ops units to monitor and influence the war.

### 4. Progression & Tiers
Progression in FsF is often "evolutionary" rather than just gaining stats.
*   **Sigma's Path:** Sigma is a mercenary who begins as a "Master of Watcher" but is destined to become **True Lancer** while still alive, a feat that defies the logic of the Throne of Heroes.
*   **Thia Escardos:** After the Master Flat Escardos is "killed," a 2000-year-old experiment within his Magic Crest activates, birthing **Thia Escardos**, a "new phylum" of life capable of manipulating time and space on a scale that rivals Divine Spirits.

**Power Tiers (Approximate):**
*   **Tier 0 (World-Threat):** Pale Rider, Thia Escardos, Ishtar (Goddess possession).
*   **Tier 1 (Top-Class Servants):** Gilgamesh, Enkidu, Alcides (Heracles). These three are portrayed as peers who can reshape the landscape with their clashes.
*   **Tier 2 (High-Tier):** Richard I, Hippolyta, True Assassin (Hassan of the Fathomless Rift).
*   **Tier 3 (Specialized/Support):** Alexandre Dumas, Jack the Ripper (Berserker), Hansa Cervantes (Executor).

### 5. Rules & Limitations
*   **The False Grail's Limit:** The "False Grail" is merely a massive mana reservoir; it cannot grant a wish on its own. It requires the completion of the True War to function as a wish-granting device.
*   **Secrecy Failure:** The "Mystery" (secrecy of magic) is impossible to maintain in FsF. The battles are so destructive (e.g., Gilgamesh and Enkidu’s opening clash creating a massive crater) that the war becomes a public international incident.
*   **Mana Consumption:** Due to the "broken" nature of the summons, mana consumption is erratic. Some Servants (like Pale Rider) drain mana from the entire city's population rather than just their Master.

## Arcs, Sequels, Adaptations, Recent, Series Aliases
*Fate/strange Fake* is a light novel and manga series written by **Ryohgo Narita** (author of *Baccano!* and *Durarara!!*) and illustrated by **Morii Shizuki**. It is a high-stakes, ensemble-cast spinoff of the *Fate* franchise, set in a unique timeline that blends elements of both *Fate* and *Tsukihime*.

### **1. Series Overview & Canon Status**
*   **Japanese Title:** フェイト/ストレンジフェイク (*Feito/Sutorenji Feiku*)
*   **Original Title:** *Fake/states night* (released as an April Fool’s prank in 2008).
*   **Relationship to Original Series:** It is a spinoff set roughly **five years after the Fifth Holy Grail War** (around 2008–2009). While it follows the events of *Fate/Zero* and *Fate/stay night*, it exists in a "mixed" timeline where both Heroic Spirits (Fate) and the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors (Tsukihime) exist simultaneously—a rarity in Type-Moon lore.
*   **Canon Status:** It is considered a parallel world (pseudepigraphon). While not "mainline" canon to the *stay night* visual novel, it is a fully official part of the Type-Moon multiverse.

### **2. Major Story Arcs & Plot Summary**
The story is centered on a "Fake" Holy Grail War orchestrated by a U.S.-based organization in **Snowfield, Nevada**. Because the ritual is a flawed copy, it malfunctions, leading to two distinct phases:

*   **The False Holy Grail War Arc (Volumes 1–5):**
    *   Six "False" Servants are summoned (missing the Saber class).
    *   **Key Events:** The summoning of Gilgamesh (Archer) and his reunion with Enkidu (Lancer); the emergence of the "Pale Rider" (Pestilence); and the arrival of Lord El-Melloi II’s student, Flat Escardos, who summons a bizarre version of Jack the Ripper.
*   **The True Holy Grail War Arc (Volumes 5–9+):**
    *   As the False War reaches its peak, a "True" Holy Grail War is triggered to stabilize the ritual, bringing seven more Servants into the fray, including a True Saber (Richard the Lionheart).
    *   **Key Events:** The "Neo-Ishtar Temple Raid" where the goddess Ishtar (possessing a homunculus) becomes a "raid boss" threat to the entire city. Characters like Rin Tohsaka and the El-Melloi Classroom join the conflict to prevent a global catastrophe.

### **3. Timeline & Continuity**
*   **Timeline Position:** Set in **August 2008/2009**.
    *   **15 years after** *Fate/Zero* (1994).
    *   **5 years after** *Fate/stay night* (2004).
    *   **Concurrent with/After** *Lord El-Melloi II Case Files*.
*   **Related Series:**
    *   ***Lord El-Melloi II Case Files/Adventures:*** Directly linked via **Flat Escardos**. The *Adventures* sequel series mentions the events of Snowfield.
    *   ***Fate/stay night:*** References the dismantling of the Fuyuki Grail.
