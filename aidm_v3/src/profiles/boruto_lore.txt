## Recent
As of January 2026, the **Boruto** franchise is in its second major phase, titled ***Boruto: Two Blue Vortex***. This sequel takes place after a three-year time skip and has significantly shifted the tone of the series toward a darker, high-stakes narrative.

### **1. Manga: Latest Arc & Current Events**
The manga is currently serialized monthly in *V Jump*. As of **January 9, 2026**, the story has moved past the initial "Return to Konoha" arc and is deep into the **Shinju Invasion/Prescience Arc**.

*   **Latest Chapter:** **Chapter 30** is scheduled for release on **January 20, 2026**.
*   **Recent Major Events (Chapters 25–29):**
    *   **The Shinju Threat:** The primary antagonists are the **Shinju**—sentient, humanoid clones of the Ten-Tails created from those trapped in trees (Claw Grimes). Key Shinju include **Jura** (the leader), **Hidari** (Sasuke’s clone), and **Matsuri** (Moegi’s clone).
    *   **The Revival of Moegi:** In recent chapters, Konohamaru successfully used a "thorn soul bulb" to revive **Moegi**, effectively extracting her from the Shinju "Matsuri." This has provided a glimmer of hope for saving others trapped in the trees, including Sasuke Uchiha.
    *   **Himawari & Kurama:** A massive revelation confirmed that **Kurama (the Nine-Tails)** has been reborn inside **Himawari Uzumaki**. She has begun training with the Tailed Beast to master her new powers, which are said to be uniquely compatible with her lineage.
    *   **Gaara & Shinki:** Recent updates confirmed that **Gaara** and **Shinki** are safe after a confrontation with the Shinju in the Sand Village. Shinki was temporarily turned into a Shinju but has been restored.
    *   **The "Omnipotence" Fallout:** Most of the world still believes Boruto killed Naruto and that Kawaki is Naruto’s true son due to Eida’s reality-warping "Omnipotence." However, **Shikamaru (the 8th Hokage)** has secretly allied with Boruto after realizing the truth through logic and Boruto’s testimony.

### **2. Boruto’s New Powers**
The time skip has transformed Boruto into one of the strongest characters in the franchise:
*   **Rasengan Uzuhiko:** A planetary-scale technique that uses the Earth's rotation to inflict semi-permanent vertigo and internal damage on an opponent.
*   **Flying Raijin (Flying Thunder God):** Boruto has mastered his grandfather Minato’s teleportation jutsu, though he admits he isn't as proficient with it yet.
*   **Uchiha Combat Style:** Having trained under Sasuke for a year before Sasuke was sealed, Boruto utilizes a sword and many of Sasuke’s signature tactical maneuvers.

### **3. Anime Status & Updates**
The *Boruto: Naruto Next Generations* anime ended its first part in March 2023 with Episode 293.

*   **Return Date:** There is **no official release date** for Part 2 (*Two Blue Vortex*) as of January 2026. 
*   **Production Rumors:** Studio Pierrot has shifted toward a "seasonal" model (similar to *Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War*) to ensure higher animation quality. Industry leaks suggest a potential announcement at **Jump Festa** or during the **10th Anniversary of the manga (May 2026)**, with a likely broadcast window in **late 2026 or 2027**.
*   **Special Episodes:** Four long-delayed "anniversary" episodes of the original *Naruto* series are rumored to finally air in **late 2026**, which may serve as a lead-in to the return of the Boruto anime.

### **4. Key Character Status Summary**
| Character | Current Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Boruto** | Rogue ninja; secretly working with Shikamaru and Kashin Koji. |
| **Kawaki** | Living in Konoha as "Naruto's son"; obsessed with killing all Otsutsuki. |
| **Naruto & Hinata** | Still sealed in a timeless dimension (Daikokuten) by Kawaki; they have not aged. |
| **Sasuke Uchiha** | Currently trapped in a Divine Tree; his Shinju clone is **Hidari**. |
| **Sarada Uchiha** | Active in Konoha; one of the few immune to Omnipotence; has awakened Mangekyou Sharingan. |
| **Kashin Koji** | Boruto’s current mentor; using his "Prescience" ability to see various future timelines. |

## Power System
The power system in *Boruto* expands upon the foundation of *Naruto* by introducing biological data-based powers and "godly" techniques that transcend traditional chakra molding.

### **1. Core Mechanics**
The *Boruto* power system operates on three primary layers:

*   **Chakra & Senjutsu:** The traditional system. Chakra is molded from physical and mental energy. Senjutsu adds "Nature Energy" to this mix. In *Boruto*, this is considered the "base" layer, often viewed as a "cheap imitation" of higher powers by the Otsutsuki.
*   **Karma (Kāma):** A biological "backup file" of an Otsutsuki’s DNA. It is a compressed rhombus-shaped seal implanted into a host (vessel).
    *   **Mechanism:** It slowly "uncompresses," rewriting the host's DNA into Otsutsuki DNA. Once 100% extracted, the host's soul is replaced by the Otsutsuki.
    *   **Combat Buffs:** Grants the host access to the Otsutsuki's combat experience, massive chakra reserves, and physical enhancements.
*   **Shinjutsu (Divine Arts):** The progenitor of all Ninjutsu. These are "miracles" performed without hand signs, derived from the DNA of the Otsutsuki God, Shibai. Unlike Ninjutsu, which manipulates chakra, Shinjutsu often manipulates reality, fate, or biological laws.

---

### **2. Key Abilities**
#### **Karma-Specific Abilities**
*   **Chakra Absorption:** The ability to nullify and absorb any chakra-based Ninjutsu.
*   **Space-Time Ninjutsu:** Users can open portals to different dimensions.
*   **Stat Amplification:** Massive boosts to speed, strength, and durability.
*   **Inherited Hax:** Vessels can use the specific Shinjutsu of their "parent" Otsutsuki (e.g., Kawaki using Isshiki’s *Sukunahikona* to shrink objects).

#### **Dojutsu (Ocular Powers)**
*   **Jougan (Pure Eye):** Unique to Boruto. It can perceive chakra pathways, see "cracks" in dimensions, and predict space-time jumps. Its full potential is still being explored in the manga.
*   **Senrigan:** Eida’s ability to see any event in the past or present, up until her birth.
*   **Daikokuten:** The ability to store objects in a pocket dimension where time is frozen and summon them instantly.

#### **New-Era Ninjutsu**
*   **Rasengan Uzuhiko:** Boruto’s ultimate technique in *Two Blue Vortex*. It utilizes the **centrifugal force of the planet's rotation**. It inflicts "perpetual damage" and disorientation that lasts as long as the Earth continues to spin.
*   **Vanishing Rasengan:** A Rasengan infused with Lightning Release that becomes invisible mid-flight.

---

### **3. Rules & Limitations**
*   **The "Natural Element" Rule:** Karma can absorb chakra-based fire or lightning, but it **cannot** absorb natural elements (e.g., real fire from a mountain or water from a lake). This is a primary tactical weakness.
*   **Possession Risk:** Using Karma accelerates the extraction process. If a vessel’s chakra is depleted, the Otsutsuki consciousness (like Momoshiki) can temporarily take full control of the body.
*   **Compatibility:** Most humans die instantly upon receiving a Karma seal. Only "perfect vessels" can survive the DNA rewrite.
*   **Shinjutsu Constraints:** While Shinjutsu doesn't require hand signs, many (like Eida’s *Omnipotence* or Daemon’s *Reflection*) are passive or subconscious, meaning the user cannot always control exactly how they manifest.

---

### **4. Power Tiers & Progression**
The series has seen a massive "power creep" compared to the original *Naruto* series.

| Tier | Representative Characters | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **God Tier** | Shibai Otsutsuki | Beings who have ascended beyond physical form and manipulate reality. |
| **Otsutsuki Tier** | Isshiki, Baryon Mode Naruto, Boruto (TBV), Daemon | Characters who can solo entire villages. Their speed is "massively faster than light." |
| **Vessel Tier** | Code (No Limiters), Kawaki (V2 Karma) | High-level threats with Shinjutsu-level "hax" but lacking the "perfect" mastery of the top tier. |
| **Elite Shinobi** | Sasuke (Pre-nerf), Kashin Koji, Sarada (Mangekyou) | The peak of human Ninjutsu. They can challenge Otsutsuki but usually require strategy or teamwork. |
| **Standard Shinobi** | Konohamaru, Mitsuki, New Gen Genin | Traditional ninja levels. Largely irrelevant against the main Otsutsuki threats. |

**Progression in *Two Blue Vortex*:**
Following the three-year timeskip, Boruto has progressed from a "talented Genin" to arguably the strongest character in the series. He has mastered **Flying Raijin** (Minato's teleportation) and developed **Uzuhiko**, allowing him to defeat "Otsutsuki-level" threats like Code in his base form without even activating his Karma.

## Combat
Boruto Uzumaki’s combat evolution is defined by a transition from a gifted but impulsive "spoiled brat" to a cold, hyper-efficient tactical master. Unlike his father, Naruto, who often relied on overwhelming chakra and brute force, Boruto’s style is a surgical blend of **Uchiha-style swordsmanship**, **Hyuga-style precision**, and **Uzumaki-style ingenuity**.

### 1. Combat Fighting Style: The "Quality Over Quantity" Approach
Boruto is a natural prodigy who masters techniques with minimal effort, leading to a diverse and versatile arsenal:
*   **Shadow Clone Tactics:** While Naruto could summon thousands of clones, Boruto is limited to a few (usually four). This forced him to develop "Quality Shadow Clones"—using them for complex maneuvers like the **Boruto Stream**, where clones use Wind Style: Gale Palm to propel the original at high speeds.
*   **Kenjutsu (Swordsmanship):** Post-timeskip (*Two Blue Vortex*), Boruto adopts a katana and a fighting style inspired by **Iaido (Iaijutsu)**. His movements are minimal and deadly, focusing on speed and timing to end fights with a single strike.
*   **Elemental Versatility:** He is one of the few shinobi to master three nature transformations (Wind, Lightning, and Water) at a young age. He frequently coats shuriken in lightning or uses water-style projectiles to control the battlefield.

### 2. Tactical Intelligence: High Battle IQ
Boruto is widely considered to have a higher "Battle IQ" than Naruto at the same age. He treats combat like a chess match:
*   **The Ao Battle:** This is often cited as his most tactical fight. Boruto analyzed the weaknesses of Scientific Ninja Tools, using a shadow clone to bait Ao into a trap and utilizing a chakra blade to drain the opponent's energy.
*   **Vanishing Rasengan:** His signature move is a tactical masterpiece. By subconsciously adding Lightning Style to a Rasengan, he makes it invisible mid-flight. This allows him to bypass the visual defenses of god-tier enemies like Momoshiki Otsutsuki.
*   **Rasengan Uzuhiko:** His most advanced tactical tool post-timeskip. It utilizes the **centrifugal force of the planet's rotation**. Once it hits, the victim suffers permanent vertigo and internal damage because their body is literally out of sync with the Earth's spin.

### 3. Emotional Depth: From Impulsive to Stoic
Boruto’s fighting style is a direct reflection of his emotional state:
*   **Pre-Timeskip (Emotional/Flashy):** Early Boruto fought to prove himself to his father. His style was flashy and often relied on "cheating" (Scientific Ninja Tools) because he lacked the emotional discipline to train.
*   **Post-Timeskip (The "Living Ice Block"):** After losing his family and being hunted by his own village, Boruto became a "stoic" fighter. Fans often compare him to **Sasuke 2.0**. He no longer wastes words or movements; his combat is cold, calculated, and devoid of the "Talk no Jutsu" optimism of his father. This stoicism is a defense mechanism against the burden of the **Karma seal**, which threatens to let Momoshiki take over if he loses control of his emotions.

### 4. Flashy Spectacle Battles
The series is known for high-budget "spectacle" episodes that showcase fluid animation and high stakes:
*   **Naruto & Sasuke vs. Momoshiki (Ep. 65):** Regarded as one of the best-animated fights in anime history. It showcases the synergy between the old generation and Boruto’s final blow, blending tactical teamwork with massive visual spectacle.
*   **Kawaki vs. Garou (Ep. 189):** A brutal, high-fidelity fight that introduced the "manga-style" aesthetic to the anime. It highlighted the destructive power of the Karma seal and the "body weaponization" style that contrasts with Boruto’s traditional ninja arts.
*   **Naruto vs. Isshiki (Baryon Mode):** While not Boruto’s fight, it represents the emotional peak of the series. The spectacle of the "Baryon Mode" transformation and the sacrifice of Kurama set the stage for Boruto’s darker, more serious path in the timeskip.

### 5. The Jougan (Pure Eye)
Though rare, the **Jougan** adds a supernatural tactical layer to his combat. It allows him to:
*   **See Chakra Pathways:** Similar to the Byakugan, but it can also identify "weak points" in a person’s chakra.
*   **Detect Dimensional Rifts:** It allows him to see through space-time ninjutsu, predicting where enemies like Urashiki or Momoshiki will appear before they do.

## Locations
The world of *Boruto* is a modernized version of the shinobi world established in *Naruto*. While the core geography remains the same, the setting has shifted from a collection of hidden military villages to a globalized society characterized by rapid technological advancement, peace between the Five Great Nations, and the emergence of interdimensional threats.

### **1. World Geography & The Five Great Nations**
The story primarily takes place on an unnamed continent divided among the Five Great Shinobi Nations. In the *Boruto* era, these nations are no longer at war and are connected by the **Thunder Rail** (a continental train system).

*   **Land of Fire (Konohagakure):** The central and most powerful nation. It has transitioned into a technological hub.
*   **Land of Wind (Sunagakure):** Located to the southwest, it remains a vast desert. Under Gaara’s leadership, it maintains a strong alliance with Konoha.
*   **Land of Earth (Iwagakure):** To the northwest, characterized by rocky terrain. It faced internal turmoil during the "Fabrications" crisis involving the former Tsuchikage, Onoki.
*   **Land of Lightning (Kumogakure):** To the northeast, a mountainous region. It is known for its high-tech weaponry and the floating Turtle Island.
*   **Land of Water (Kirigakure):** An island nation to the east. Once the "Bloody Mist," it has modernized into a tourist destination, though it still struggles with traditionalist factions like the New Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

### **2. Key Locations in Konohagakure (Modern Leaf)**
Konoha has expanded significantly, resembling a modern city with skyscrapers and industrial zones.
*   **Hokage Rock:** The iconic mountain featuring the faces of the Hokage. In *Boruto*, it is often the site of major battles or a vantage point for the city.
*   **Kaminarimon Company:** The massive corporation responsible for the village's technological boom, including the Thunder Train and portable gaming devices.
*   **Scientific Ninja Weapons Team Lab:** A facility where Katasuke Tono develops "Kote" (ninja tools) and prosthetic limbs.
*   **The Sky District:** An abandoned Uchiha supply base located on the outskirts, used by Boruto for training during the *Two Blue Vortex* era.
*   **The Academy:** Modernized with digital classrooms, it now offers courses in both ninjutsu and general subjects like science and literature.

### **3. Significant New Regions & Landmarks**
*   **Land of Valleys:** A region distant from the Land of Fire, home to Victor’s medical manufacturing company. It was the site of a failed attempt to grow an artificial God Tree.
*   **Land of Silence:** A lawless, "wild west" region for disgraced ninja and criminals. It serves as a hub for the black market and was a key location during the search for Hashirama cells.
*   **Land of Snow:** A canon location (originally from the first *Naruto* movie) that houses one of **Boro’s cult facilities**. This is where Eida and Daemon were kept in stasis.
*   **Land of Iron:** The land of the Samurai. In the *Boruto* era, it maintains a student exchange program with Konoha (e.g., Tsubaki Kurogane).
*   **Hozuki Castle (Blood Prison):** A high-security prison run by the Hidden Grass Village. Boruto and Mitsuki infiltrated it to protect a defector from the Mujina Bandits.

### **4. Interdimensional Settings**
The introduction of the Otsutsuki Clan and the organization Kara expanded the map into other dimensions.
*   **Daikokuten:** A dimension where time does not flow. It is Isshiki Otsutsuki’s personal space, later inherited by Kawaki, who uses it to "store" Naruto and Hinata.
*   **Kara’s Main Hideout:** A base located in a barren, dark dimension accessible only via Space-Time Ninjutsu. It contains a juvenile Ten-Tails and holograms of the Otsutsuki.
*   **Kaguya’s Dimensions:** Six distinct worlds (Lava, Ice, Desert, Acid, Gravity, and the Core dimension) that Sasuke continues to investigate for Otsutsuki traces.
*   **The Shinju Dimension:** A surreal location appearing in *Two Blue Vortex* where the sentient Divine Trees (Shinju) reside and plan their hunt for "prey."

### **5. Sage Regions**
*   **Ryūchi Cave:** The home of the White Snake Sage. Boruto and his friends traveled here to find Mitsuki. It is a dark, illusory place where seekers must pass deadly trials to gain knowledge or Sage powers.
*   **Mount Myōboku:** The land of toads. While less central than in *Naruto*, it remains the source of the toads summoned by Konohamaru and the clone Kashin Koji.

## Sequels, Series Aliases
The *Boruto* series is the official continuation of Masashi Kishimoto’s *Naruto* franchise. It spans multiple media formats, including manga, anime, light novels, and films, with a complex relationship between its various parts and the original series.

### **1. Series Titles and Abbreviations**
*   **Japanese Title:** BORUTO （ボルト）
*   **Full Title (Part 1):** *Boruto: Naruto Next Generations*
*   **Full Title (Part 2):** *Boruto: Two Blue Vortex*
*   **Romanized Name:** *Boruto* is the Japanese pronunciation of the English word **"Bolt,"** a tribute to Neji Hyuga (whose name means "Screw").
*   **Common Abbreviations:**
    *   **NNG:** *Naruto Next Generations* (Part 1)
    *   **TBV:** *Two Blue Vortex* (Part 2)

---

### **2. Relationship to the Original Series**
*   **Sequel Status:** *Boruto* is a direct sequel to *Naruto*. It begins approximately 15 years after the Fourth Shinobi World War and follows the children of the original cast.
*   **Continuity:** It follows the "Manga Canon" timeline established in the 700 chapters of *Naruto*. However, it specifically builds on the lore of the **Otsutsuki Clan** introduced at the end of *Naruto Shippuden*.

---

### **3. Sequels, Prequels, and Spinoffs**

#### **Sequels**
*   **Boruto: Two Blue Vortex (TBV):** This is the official manga sequel to *Boruto: Naruto Next Generations*. It takes place after a **three-year timeskip**, mirroring the transition from *Naruto* to *Naruto Shippuden*. It is currently ongoing in *V Jump*.

#### **Prequels / Preludes**
*   **Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring:** A 10-chapter mini-series (often called *Naruto Gaiden*) written by Kishimoto. It focuses on Sarada Uchiha and serves as a bridge between *Naruto* and *Boruto*.
*   **Naruto: The Path Lit by the Full Moon:** A one-shot manga focusing on Mitsuki’s origins. It is included in the first volume of the *Boruto* manga.

#### **Spinoffs**
*   **Boruto: Saikyo Dash Generations:** A "super-deformed" (SD) gag manga by Kenji Taira. It features comedic, non-canon versions of the characters.
*   **Naruto: Sasuke’s Story—The Uchiha and the Heavenly Stardust:** A spinoff manga (adapted from a light novel) that takes place during the *Boruto* era but focuses on Sasuke and Sakura.

---

### **4. Continuity and Canon Differences**
The *Boruto* franchise is unique because its anime and manga are often treated as **parallel continuities** rather than a strict 1:1 adaptation.

*   **Manga Canon:** Focuses strictly on the core plot involving the Karma mark, Kara, and the Otsutsuki. It is concise and moves quickly.
*   **Anime Canon:** The anime includes "Anime Canon" arcs that are not in the manga but are considered official parts of the anime's timeline. These arcs provide character development for side characters (like Denki or Iwabe) who rarely appear in the manga.
*   **Key Differences:**
    *   **The Chunin Exams:** The *Boruto* movie (2015), the manga, and the anime all depict the Chunin Exams differently. The anime version is the most expanded, adding characters like Urashiki Otsutsuki who do not exist in the manga.
    *   **Character Ranks:** In the anime, characters like Shikadai are promoted to Chunin early, whereas the manga often refers to them as Genin for longer periods.

---

### **5. Alternate Timelines and "What-Ifs"**
*   **The "10 Directions" (Shinjutsu):** In *Two Blue Vortex*, a divine ability called **Prescience** (or "10 Directions") is introduced. It allows users like Kashin Koji to see multiple potential futures. This introduces the concept of **alternate timelines** where different outcomes occurred (e.g., timelines where Boruto or Naruto died), though the story remains focused on one "true" timeline.
*   **Non-Canon Media:** 
    *   **Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections:** Features a "Special Story" mode with an original plot involving a "Fifth Great Ninja War." This is considered **non-canon** and exists as a "What-If" scenario for the game.
    *   **Boruto Light Novels:** There are five light novels that adapt the early "Academy" arcs of the anime. While they are official, they are often considered "secondary canon" unless referenced by the manga.

## Arcs
The *Boruto* series is divided into two distinct parts: **Boruto: Naruto Next Generations** (Part 1) and **Boruto: Two Blue Vortex** (Part 2). The story transitions from a lighthearted exploration of a peaceful ninja world to a high-stakes struggle against alien gods and the erasure of Boruto's own identity.

---

Part 1 covers Boruto’s childhood, his graduation from the Academy, and the emergence of the Kara organization.

#### **1. Academy & Genin Era (Episodes 1–52)**

#### **3. The Kara Saga (Episodes 148–220 / Manga Ch. 11–55)**
*   **Mujina Bandits Arc:** Boruto protects a daimyo’s son and learns that his Karma mark is linked to an underground organization called **Kara**.

Set **three years later**, Part 2 follows a 15-year-old Boruto who has become a powerful, cold, and calculated rogue ninja.

#### **1. Boruto’s Return Arc (Manga Ch. 1–Ongoing)**
*   **The Invasion of Konoha:** Code attacks Konoha with an army of "Claw Grimes." Boruto returns to the village, showcasing massive power upgrades, including the **Rasengan Uzuhiko**, which uses the Earth's rotation to deal infinite damage.
*   **The Shinju (Sentient God Trees):** The Claw Grimes evolve into sentient beings called **Shinju**, clones of people they have consumed (including a clone of Sasuke). These beings seek to consume specific targets to gain knowledge.
*   **Current Status:** Boruto is working as a vigilante alongside **Kashin Koji**. He is trying to save Sasuke (who was turned into a tree) and clear his name while avoiding Kawaki and the village's forces.

---

### **Major Timeline Progression**

| Event | Timeline Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Post-War Peace** | 15 years after the 4th Shinobi World War. |
| **Academy Graduation** | Boruto is ~12 years old. |
| **Momoshiki Attack** | Boruto receives the Karma mark. |

## Adaptations
The *Boruto* franchise is a complex multimedia project with significant differences between its various versions. Unlike its predecessor *Naruto*, where the anime followed the manga closely, *Boruto* was developed as a "parallel" story where both the manga and anime are considered canon but offer different experiences.

### **1. Core Adaptations & Versions**
The story of Boruto Uzumaki exists across three primary formats:

*   **Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015):** The original introduction to the character, written by Masashi Kishimoto. It covers the Chunin Exams and the battle against Momoshiki.
*   **Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016–2023):**
    *   **Manga:** Initially written by Ukyō Kodachi and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto. It began as a retelling of the movie before moving into original territory.
    *   **Anime:** Produced by Studio Pierrot. It began as a prequel to the manga/movie, focusing on Boruto’s time in the Ninja Academy.
*   **Boruto: Two Blue Vortex (2023–Present):** The post-timeskip sequel. Currently, this exists only as a **manga**, though an anime adaptation is confirmed to be in production.

---

### **2. Manga vs. Anime: Key Differences**
The most striking difference is the **pacing and scope**. The manga is a monthly publication that focuses strictly on the "tl;dr" core plot, while the anime is a weekly series that expands the world.

| Feature | Boruto Manga | Boruto Anime |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pacing** | Fast-paced; focuses only on major battles and plot points. | Slower; includes slice-of-life and world-building. |
| **Start Point** | Retells the *Boruto* movie (Chunin Exams). | Starts as a prequel (Academy Entrance arc). |
| **Canon Type** | "Manga Canon" (The core storyline). | "Anime Canon" (Expanded lore approved by creators). |
| **Side Characters** | Minimal focus on characters like Mitsuki, Sarada, or Class 1-A. | Heavy focus on Team 7 and other Genin teams. |
| **The Jougan** | Rarely appears; its powers remain mysterious. | Introduced in Episode 1; central to early arcs. |
| **Villains** | Focuses almost exclusively on Kara and the Otsutsuki. | Adds original villains like **Urashiki Otsutsuki** and Deepa. |

---

### **3. Major Changes & Adaptations**
#### **The "Anime-Canon" Concept**
Because the manga is monthly, the anime would have caught up in less than a year if it followed the manga strictly. To avoid "filler" (non-consequential stories), the creators introduced **Anime-Canon**. These arcs are not in the manga but are considered part of the official timeline.
*   **Kara Actuation Arc:** The anime added this arc to give the villainous organization "Kara" more depth and to show Team 7 training specifically to defeat them—a process skipped in the manga.
*   **Time Slip Arc:** An anime-exclusive 20th-anniversary arc where Boruto and Sasuke travel back in time to the original *Naruto* era.

#### **Character Designs & Controversy**
The manga artist, Mikio Ikemoto, has a distinct style that differs from Masashi Kishimoto’s.
*   **Sarada Uchiha:** Her manga design (short dress, high heels) was highly controversial for being "over-sexualized" for a child. The anime significantly altered her outfit to a more practical, "ninja-appropriate" look.
*   **Momoshiki Otsutsuki:** His final transformation looks different in the movie versus the manga/anime. The manga/anime version (Ikemoto's design) is more demonic and sleek compared to the movie's bulkier version.

#### **Fight Choreography**
The anime is widely praised for "fixing" or expanding manga fights. For example, the **Naruto & Sasuke vs. Momoshiki** fight (Episode 65) is significantly longer and more choreographed in the anime than in the manga or movie.

---

### **4. The Transition of Writers**
In November 2020 (Chapter 52), the original writer **Ukyō Kodachi** stepped down, and **Masashi Kishimoto** (the creator of *Naruto*) took over the writing duties. 
*   **Impact:** Fans noted a shift toward a darker, higher-stakes tone and a heavier focus on legacy characters like Naruto and Sasuke during the transition, leading into the "Omnipotence" arc that concludes Part 1.

---

### **5. Current Status (January 2026)**
*   **Manga:** *Boruto: Two Blue Vortex* is currently the "hottest" era of the franchise. It features a three-year timeskip where Boruto is a rogue ninja and the world has been "rewritten" by Eida's powers.
*   **Anime:** The anime has been on hiatus since March 2023 (ending at Episode 293). Recent reports and voice actor updates suggest that **Part 2 is in production** and may follow a **seasonal format** (similar to *Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War*) to ensure higher animation quality and zero filler. A 2026 or 2027 release is widely anticipated.

## Characters
The *Boruto* series, particularly its second part *Boruto: Two Blue Vortex*, focuses on a new generation of ninja facing god-like threats from the Otsutsuki clan and the sentient "Shinju" (Divine Tree) clones.

### **Main Protagonists**

#### **1. Boruto Uzumaki**
*   **Role:** The titular protagonist. Initially a "bratty" prodigy seeking his father’s attention, he matures into a stoic, highly skilled shinobi. Following the "Omnipotence" event, he is falsely labeled a rogue ninja who "killed" Naruto.

    *   **Super Strength:** Inherited from her mother, Sakura, allowing her to deliver devastating physical blows.
    *   **Immunity:** One of the few characters (alongside Sumire Kakei) immune to Eida’s "Omnipotence," allowing her to remember Boruto’s true identity.
*   **Relationships:** Daughter of Sasuke and Sakura. She is Boruto's closest ally and potential love interest.

#### **3. Mitsuki**

### **The Deuteragonist / Antagonist**

#### **Kawaki Uzumaki**
*   **Role:** A former "vessel" for Isshiki Otsutsuki who was adopted by Naruto. His obsession with protecting Naruto led him to seal the Hokage away and use Eida’s power to swap lives with Boruto.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Karma (Isshiki’s Powers):** Grants him **Sukunahikona** (shrinking objects/himself) and **Daikokuten** (storing objects in a timeless dimension).
    *   **Scientific Ninja Tool Body:** His body is modified with microscopic technology, allowing him to shapeshift his limbs into blades or energy cannons.
*   **Relationships:** Adoptive son of Naruto; rival/brother to Boruto. He currently acts as a "hero" of Konoha while hunting Boruto to eliminate the Otsutsuki threat within him.

### **Primary Antagonists**

#### **1. The Shinju Clones (Two Blue Vortex)**
These are sentient incarnations of the Ten-Tails created when Code’s "Claw Grimes" consumed powerful shinobi.
*   **Jura:** The leader; a clone of an unknown individual (possibly Isshiki or a manifestation of the Ten-Tails itself). He can fire Tailed Beast Bombs from his Rinnegan.
*   **Hidari:** A clone of **Sasuke Uchiha**. He possesses Sasuke’s Chidori and swordsmanship but lacks his original memories.
*   **Matsuri:** A clone of Moegi Kazamatsuri, utilizing Earth Style and Wood Release.
*   **Ryu:** A clone of Shinki, capable of manipulating Iron Sand with lethal precision.

#### **2. Code**
*   **Role:** The last remaining "Inner" of the Kara organization. He possesses a "White Karma" that grants him power but cannot serve as a vessel for resurrection.
*   **Abilities:** **Claw Marks**, which act as portals he can place on any surface or person to teleport instantly.

#### **3. Momoshiki Otsutsuki**
*   **Role:** A lingering spirit within Boruto’s Karma. He seeks to completely take over Boruto’s body to resurrect himself and consume the world's chakra.

## Factions
The world of *Boruto* is defined by a shift from the constant warfare of the *Naruto* era to a "Cold War" dynamic characterized by rapid technological advancement, cosmic threats, and shifting internal loyalties.

### **1. World Powers & Global Alliances**
The geopolitical landscape has evolved from five warring nations into a unified global cooperative.

*   **The Shinobi Union:** The successor to the Allied Shinobi Forces from the Fourth Great Ninja War. It functions like a "United Nations" for ninjas, where the Five Great Nations (Fire, Wind, Water, Earth, and Lightning) collaborate on security, technology, and disaster relief.
*   **The Five Great Shinobi Nations:**
    *   **Konohagakure (Land of Fire):** The dominant power, led by the Seventh Hokage (Naruto Uzumaki) and later Shikamaru Nara. It is the hub of scientific and political progress.
    *   **Sunagakure (Land of Wind):** Led by Gaara; maintains the strongest military bond with Konoha.
    *   **Kumogakure, Kirigakure, and Iwagakure:** These villages remain sovereign but are deeply integrated into the Union’s trade and defense pacts.
*   **The Land of Iron:** A neutral nation of **Samurai** led by General Mifune. It serves as the traditional meeting ground for the Five Kage due to its neutrality and lack of shinobi.

### **2. Major Antagonist Organizations**
The enemies in *Boruto* have shifted from rogue ninjas (like the Akatsuki) to parasitic aliens and sentient bio-weapons.

*   **Kara (The Shell):** A secret society founded by **Isshiki Otsutsuki** (in the body of Jigen).
    *   **Structure:** Divided into **Inners** (elite, scientifically modified members like Delta, Boro, and Code) and **Outers** (spies and sleeper agents like Ao and Garō).
    *   **Goal:** To cultivate a God Tree on Earth, harvest its Chakra Fruit, and achieve godhood.
*   **The Otsutsuki Clan:** A celestial race of "parasitic aliens" who travel across dimensions to consume the life force of planets.
    *   **Key Members:** Momoshiki, Kinshiki, Urashiki, and Isshiki.
    *   **Shibai Otsutsuki:** A legendary figure who achieved true godhood, leaving his physical body behind; his remains were used by Amado to grant "Shinjutsu" (god-tier abilities) to Kara members.
*   **The Shinju (Divine Tree Incarnates):** Introduced in *Two Blue Vortex*, these are sentient versions of the Ten-Tails created when Code’s "Claw Grimes" evolved.
    *   **Members:** **Jura** (Leader), **Hidari** (Sasuke’s clone), **Matsuri** (Moegi’s clone), and **Ryu** (Shinki’s clone).
    *   **Goal:** Unlike the mindless Ten-Tails, they possess self-awareness and seek to devour specific "targets" (like Boruto, Sarada, and Konohamaru) to gain knowledge and complete their evolution.

### **3. Specialized Groups & Factions**
*   **Scientific Ninja Weapons Team:** A Konoha division led by **Katasuke Tōno**. They develop "Scientific Ninja Tools" (Kote, prosthetic limbs, etc.). This group represents the tension between traditional ninjutsu and modern technology.
*   **The "Shadow Hokage" Faction:** A term for those who protect the village from the shadows, originally Sasuke Uchiha and later Boruto himself during his exile.
*   **Internal Konoha Factions (Two Blue Vortex):** Following Eida’s **Omnipotence** (which swapped Boruto and Kawaki’s lives in everyone's memories), the village is split:
    *   **Pro-Kawaki/Official Konoha:** The majority of the village, including the sensory unit and leadership, who believe Boruto killed Naruto.
    *   **The Resistance:** A small group including Sarada Uchiha and Sumire Kakei who are immune to Omnipotence and secretly support Boruto.

### **4. Minor & Rogue Groups**
*   **Mujina Bandits:** A criminal organization led by Shojoji, known for the "Corpse Clone" technique. They represent the "street-level" crime that still exists in a peaceful era.
*   **Byakuya Gang:** A group of "noble thieves" (Robin Hood-style) who stole from the rich to give to the poor, highlighting the economic inequality caused by rapid modernization.
*   **Boro’s Cult:** A religious group that worshipped the Otsutsuki as gods, used by Kara as a source of experimental subjects and "vessels."

## Tone
The *Boruto* series (encompassing both *Naruto Next Generations* and *Two Blue Vortex*) is defined by a dramatic tonal evolution. It begins as a lighthearted, optimistic "slice-of-life" sequel and descends into a dark, psychological "noir" drama.

### **1. Tone and Atmosphere**
*   **Early Tone (Optimism & Peace):** The series starts in an era of unprecedented peace achieved by Naruto. The atmosphere is vibrant, colorful, and relatively low-stakes. Boruto is portrayed as a "silver spoon" kid, and the early arcs focus on his bratty rebellion against his busy father.
*   **The Shift (Darkness & Dread):** As the threat of the Otsutsuki and the Kara organization emerges, the tone shifts. The atmosphere becomes "colder" and more "mechanical." The vibrant colors of the early anime are replaced by a desaturated, more serious aesthetic in the manga and post-timeskip era.
*   **Two Blue Vortex (Noir & Isolation):** The second part of the series is described as a **"noir drama."** Boruto is no longer a student but a renegade master. The atmosphere is heavy with fate, isolation, and the "bitter truth" vs. "sweet lies."

### **2. Themes**
*   **Legacy vs. Identity:** Boruto’s struggle to step out of Naruto’s shadow while carrying the "Will of Fire."
*   **Technology vs. Tradition:** A central conflict between "Scientific Ninja Tools" (easy power) and traditional shinobi training (hard work).
*   **Overcoming Destiny:** Momoshiki’s prophecy that Boruto’s "blue eyes will take everything" from him. The series explores whether one can change a predestined, tragic fate.
*   **Parenting and Generational Gaps:** The series mirrors real-world "Millennial vs. Gen Z" dynamics, focusing on the hardships of high-authority parents and the expectations placed on their children.

### **3. Genre and Mood**
*   **Genre:** Primarily **Shonen Action/Adventure**, but it increasingly incorporates elements of **Psychological Thriller**, **Sci-Fi** (alien lore and cyborgs), and **Noir**.
*   **Mood:** 
    *   **Early:** Fun, immature, and adventurous.
    *   **Late:** Brooding, stoic, and "moody." Post-timeskip Boruto is often compared to the "Sasuke archetype"—cold, tactical, and silent.

### **4. Dark Comedy vs. Lighthearted Humor**
While *Boruto* is not a "dark comedy" by definition, it utilizes specific types of humor:
*   **Momoshiki’s Snark:** The primary source of "dark humor" comes from Momoshiki Otsutsuki, who lives inside Boruto. He frequently makes sarcastic, arrogant, and nihilistic comments about human "inferiority" and Boruto’s impending doom.
*   **"Clowning" of Villains:** Fans often find a sense of "dark irony" or comedy in the constant failures of villains like **Code**, who is frequently "clowned on" by both heroes and other villains despite his immense power.
*   **Anime Gags:** The anime retains traditional lighthearted gags (e.g., Mitsuki’s oblivious nature, Cho-Cho’s obsession with chips, and Team 7's banter), though these nearly vanish in the more focused *Two Blue Vortex* manga.

### **5. Optimism vs. Realism**
*   **Naruto’s Optimism:** The previous generation’s hope is the foundation of the world, but it is portrayed as fragile.
*   **Boruto’s Resilience:** Despite losing his home, identity, and family (due to the "Omnipotence" rewrite), Boruto remains an optimist in a darker sense. He is a "dreamer" who protects the village from the shadows without seeking recognition, embodying the "soul of a shinobi" even when the world hates him.
