## Power System
The power system in *Attack on Titan* is a biological and metaphysical network rooted in a 2,000-year-old history of war, genetics, and a transcendental dimension known as "The Paths."

### **1. Core Mechanics: The Source and The Paths**
*   **The Source of All Living Matter:** A parasitic, spine-like organism (resembling a *Hallucigenia*) that bonded with Ymir Fritz. It is the biological origin of all Titan powers.
*   **The Paths:** An invisible, transcendental network that connects all "Subjects of Ymir" (Eldians). These paths transcend space and time, allowing for the instantaneous transfer of:
    *   **Mass:** Flesh and bones are sent through Paths to form a Titan body.
    *   **Memories:** Inheritors can see the lives of previous holders.
    *   **Will/Commands:** The Founding Titan can issue orders to all Eldians.
*   **The Coordinate:** The intersection point of all Paths, manifested in a desert-like dimension. The holder of the Founding Titan serves as this Coordinate.

### **2. The Nine Titans: Abilities and Traits**
There are only nine "Intelligent Titans" (Shifters) at any given time. Each has a unique specialty:
*   **Founding Titan:** The "Coordinate." Can control other Titans, alter Eldian memories, and change their biological makeup. Requires royal blood to fully activate.
*   **Attack Titan:** Can see the memories of future inheritors, allowing it to "move forward" toward a specific destiny.
*   **Colossal Titan:** Massive (60m). Can trigger a nuclear-scale explosion upon transformation and emit intense steam to repel attackers.
*   **Armored Titan:** Covered in hardened, plate-like skin. Extremely durable, used as a "living shield."
*   **Female Titan:** High versatility. Can harden specific body parts and attract Pure Titans with a scream.
*   **Beast Titan:** Animalistic traits (varies by user). Zeke Yeager’s version excelled at long-range artillery-style throwing.
*   **Jaw Titan:** Smallest and fastest. Features near-unbreakable teeth and claws capable of crushing Titan-hardened crystal.
*   **Cart Titan:** Quadrupedal with immense endurance. Can stay in Titan form for months and carry heavy weaponry.
*   **War Hammer Titan:** Can manifest weapons (hammers, spikes, crossbows) from hardened Titan flesh. The user can control it remotely via a cord while encased in a crystal shell.

### **3. Rules and Limitations**
*   **The Curse of Ymir:** No Titan Shifter can live longer than 13 years after inheriting their power, as Ymir Fritz died 13 years after gaining her powers.
*   **Transformation Requirements:** A Shifter must suffer a physical injury (drawing blood) and have a clear, defined goal in mind.
*   **Inheritance:** If a Shifter dies without being eaten, their power is randomly born into a newborn Eldian baby via the Paths.
*   **Royal Blood:** Only those of the Fritz/Reiss bloodline can use the Founding Titan's full power. However, a non-royal Shifter (like Eren) can bypass this by making physical contact with a Titan of royal blood.

### **4. Tiers and Classification**
While there is no official "power level," the series categorizes Titans by behavior and threat:
*   **Tier 0: The Founding Titan (Full Power):** Capable of the "Rumbling" (unleashing millions of Wall Titans). God-like status.
*   **Tier 1: High-Tier Shifters:** Colossal, War Hammer, and the Evolved Attack Titan. These can decide the fate of entire armies.
*   **Tier 2: Standard Shifters:** Armored, Female, Beast, Jaw. Formidable but can be defeated by skilled humans using advanced tech.
*   **Tier 3: Abnormal Titans:** Mindless Titans that display unpredictable behavior (running, jumping, or ignoring nearby humans for strategic targets).
*   **Tier 4: Pure Titans:** Mindless, instinctive giants (3m–15m). Dangerous in swarms but predictable.

### **5. Progression and "Titan Science"**
*   **Spinal Fluid Injections:** Marleyan "Titan Science" developed serums to trigger transformations. Ingesting specific serums can grant extra abilities (e.g., Eren gaining "Hardening" after drinking a serum labeled "Armor").
*   **The Ackerman Clan:** An accidental byproduct of Titan science. They are "Titans in human form"—possessing the strength and battle experience of Titans without needing to transform. They are immune to the Founding Titan's memory manipulation.
*   **Shifter Evolution:** A Shifter can grow stronger by consuming other Shifters. By the end of the series, Eren Yeager holds three powers (Attack, Founding, War Hammer), making him exponentially more powerful than a single-power user.

## Combat
Combat in *Attack on Titan* is a masterclass in high-stakes choreography, evolving from desperate survival against mindless giants to complex, multi-layered warfare involving advanced technology and psychological manipulation.

### **1. Fighting Styles: The Art of 3D Maneuver**
The core of the series' combat is the **Omni-Directional Mobility (ODM) Gear**, which allows soldiers to fight in a three-dimensional space.
*   **The Ackerman Style:** Levi and Mikasa Ackerman possess "awakened" power (Ackerman DNA), granting them superhuman strength, speed, and "battle instincts." 
    *   **Levi’s Rotational Attack:** Levi uses a unique backhanded grip on his right blade, allowing him to spin like a "fidget spinner" or "beyblade." This creates massive angular momentum, enabling him to deliver deep, rapid-fire cuts that can strip a Titan’s arms or nape in seconds.
    *   **Mikasa’s Precision:** While less flashy than Levi, Mikasa focuses on high-speed, direct strikes and exceptional martial arts. She is often used as a "tactical nuke," sent in to finish a target once its defenses are breached.
*   **Titan Shifter Martial Arts:** Eren’s combat style evolves from raw rage to disciplined MMA. He utilizes grappling, joint locks, and hardening-reinforced strikes to defeat larger or more armored opponents like Reiner (the Armored Titan).

### **2. Tactical Warfare: Strategy Over Strength**
Battles are rarely won by brute force alone; they are won through rigid formations and technological innovation.
*   **Long-Distance Scouting Formation:** Developed by Erwin Smith, this formation uses a wide semicircle of soldiers who communicate via **smoke signals** (Red for Titans, Green for course changes, Black for Abnormals). The goal is evasion, not engagement, to preserve the Survey Corps' limited numbers.
*   **Thunder Spears:** Introduced to counter the Armored Titan, these are rocket-propelled explosives. Tactically, they are used to blind Titans (hitting the eyes) or shatter hardened armor, allowing a follow-up strike to the nape.
*   **Anti-Personnel ODM Gear:** Used by Kenny Ackerman’s squad, this gear is optimized for urban human-vs-human combat. It replaces swords with firearms and moves the grapples to the arms for better stability in tight spaces, forcing the Survey Corps to adapt their "Titan-killing" style to "human-hunting."

### **3. Emotional Weight: The "Human" Cost**
Combat in *Attack on Titan* is never just about the spectacle; it is deeply rooted in the psychological state of the combatants.
*   **The Burden of Leadership:** Erwin Smith’s "Suicide Charge" is a tactical masterpiece born of emotional manipulation. He convinces recruits that their deaths only have meaning if they provide a distraction for Levi, framing their sacrifice as a "choice" to give the living a chance.
*   **Shifter "Fatal Flaws":** Each Titan shifter’s combat effectiveness is tied to their mental state. Reiner’s performance suffers due to his dissociative identity disorder and guilt, while Eren’s initial lack of control stems from his impulsive rage.
*   **Perspectival Shift:** The Raid on Liberio transforms the protagonists from "humanity's hope" into "devils." The combat is framed as a horrific massacre of civilians, emphasizing that in war, "spectacle" for one side is "trauma" for the other.

### **4. Flashy Spectacle Battles**
The series is famous for its "high-budget" animation sequences that blend tactical depth with visual flair:
*   **The Battle of Trost (Season 1):** The first major "spectacle," defined by chaos, high mortality rates, and the shocking reveal of Eren’s Titan form.
*   **Return to Shiganshina (Season 3):** A three-front war (Levi vs. Beast Titan, Armin/Eren vs. Colossal, Mikasa/Squad vs. Armored). It is the peak of the series' tactical combat, featuring the iconic "Perfect Game" suicide charge.
*   **The Raid on Liberio (Season 4):** A "reverse-invasion" where the Survey Corps uses upgraded gear and Thunder Spears to dismantle the Marleyan military in their own home, showcasing the terrifying evolution of Paradis' technology.
*   **Battle of Heaven and Earth (Finale):** The ultimate spectacle, featuring the "Alliance" (former enemies working together) fighting hundreds of past Titan shifters atop the moving ribcage of the Founding Titan. It emphasizes teamwork and the "choices" of individuals over raw power levels.

## Tone
*Attack on Titan* (*Shingeki no Kyojin*) is a complex narrative that evolves from a straightforward survival story into a deep geopolitical and philosophical drama. Its tone and atmosphere are defined by a constant tension between despair and the "fiery will" to survive.

### **1. Genre and Mood**
*   **Genre:** Primarily **Dark Fantasy**, **Action**, and **Post-Apocalyptic**. As the story progresses, it incorporates elements of **Political Thriller**, **Mystery**, and **Horror** (specifically body horror and survival horror).
*   **Mood:** The mood is one of **hopelessness tempered by determination**. It begins with a sense of "primal dread" (humanity as prey) and shifts toward a "tragic inevitability" as the characters uncover the truth of their world. The mood is often claustrophobic, reflecting the literal and metaphorical walls that trap the characters.

### **2. Tone: "The World is Cruel but Beautiful"**
The series’ tone is anchored in Mikasa Ackerman’s mantra: *"The world is cruel, but also very beautiful."*
*   **Cruelty:** Represented by the graphic violence, the uncanniness of the Titans, and the cyclical nature of war and hatred.
*   **Beauty:** Found in the small, fleeting moments of human connection—Armin’s wonder at the sea, a shared meal among soldiers, or the simple act of "running toward a tree."
*   **Evolution:** The tone shifts from **Survivalist** (Season 1) to **Rebellious** (Season 2-3) and finally to **Somber and Existential** (Season 4), where the line between hero and villain is completely blurred.

### **3. Core Themes**
*   **Freedom vs. Slavery:** The central conflict is the pursuit of freedom. Characters are often "slaves" to something—be it revenge, duty, love, or destiny.
*   **The Cycle of Hatred:** The story explores how trauma is passed down through generations and how "children of the forest" (the next generation) are forced to pay for the sins of their ancestors.
*   **Human Nature:** It scrutinizes humanity at its most noble (sacrifice) and its most decadent (greed and xenophobia).
*   **Truth vs. Propaganda:** Much of the plot revolves around the manipulation of history and how "truth" is often a matter of perspective.

### **4. Dark Comedy and Gallows Humor**
While the series is overwhelmingly serious, it uses **gallows humor** to humanize its cast and provide brief relief from the tension.
*   **Running Gags:** Sasha Blouse’s obsession with food (the "Potato Girl" incident), Captain Levi’s extreme germaphobia and cleaning rituals, and Hange Zoë’s disturbingly affectionate obsession with Titan research.
*   **Absurdity:** Humor often arises from the absurdity of their situation, such as Connie and Sasha’s bickering during life-or-death battles or Pieck Finger’s "dog-like" behavior due to spending too much time in her Titan form.

### **5. Optimism vs. Nihilism**
The series is frequently debated as being either nihilistic or optimistic.
*   **The Nihilistic View:** Focuses on the "Cycle of Hatred" and the ending, which suggests that war is an inevitable part of human nature that will eventually repeat itself.
*   **The Optimistic/Absurdist View:** Represented by Armin Arlert, this view argues that even if life has no grand "purpose" and the cycle continues, the small moments of joy make life worth living. This is often compared to **Optimistic Nihilism** or **Absurdism**—finding meaning in a meaningless world through choice and connection.

### **6. Atmosphere**
*   **Claustrophobia:** The early seasons emphasize the feeling of being "cattle" trapped within walls.
*   **Uncanny Horror:** The Titans themselves are designed to be "wrong"—human-like but lacking proportions and social cues—triggering a deep-seated psychological discomfort.
*   **Dieselpunk/Industrial Aesthetic:** The world-building uses a blend of medieval and early industrial technology (ODM gear, flintlocks, and later, WWI-style trench warfare), creating a gritty, grounded atmosphere.

## Characters
*Attack on Titan* (Shingeki no Kyojin) features a complex cast where roles of "hero" and "villain" shift dramatically as the story progresses. Below is a detailed breakdown of the main characters, their abilities, roles, and relationships.

### **1. The Protagonist: Eren Yeager**
Eren begins as a typical heroic protagonist driven by a simple goal: to exterminate every Titan. By the final arc, he evolves into the series' ultimate **antagonist** (or anti-villain) from the perspective of the rest of the world.

*   **Abilities:** 
    *   **Titan Shifter:** Inherits the **Attack Titan** (future sight/relentless drive), the **Founding Titan** (control over all Eldians and Titans), and later the **War Hammer Titan** (structural hardening/weapon creation).
    *   **The Coordinate:** The ability to command thousands of "Wall Titans" to initiate **The Rumbling**, a global genocide.
*   **Role:** Initially a soldier in the 104th Training Corps; later the catalyst for the world's destruction to ensure his friends' survival.
*   **Relationships:** 
    *   **Mikasa & Armin:** His childhood best friends and moral anchors.
    *   **Zeke Yeager:** His half-brother; they share a complex bond but conflicting ideologies (Eren wants freedom; Zeke wants Eldian "euthanasia").

### **2. The Deuteragonists**
#### **Mikasa Ackerman**
*   **Abilities:** As an **Ackerman**, she possesses "awakened" superhuman strength, speed, and near-perfect battle instincts. She is immune to the Founding Titan’s memory manipulation.
*   **Role:** The Survey Corps' most elite frontline soldier and Eren’s primary protector.
*   **Relationships:** Deeply in love with Eren, though her devotion is often mistaken for blind obsession. She eventually has to choose between her love for him and the survival of humanity.

#### **Armin Arlert**
*   **Abilities:** 
    *   **Tactical Genius:** His greatest strength is his high intelligence and ability to formulate complex strategies under pressure.
    *   **Colossal Titan:** Later inherits the power to transform into a 60-meter Titan capable of causing nuclear-level explosions upon transformation.
*   **Role:** The moral compass and strategist of the group; eventually becomes the **15th Commander of the Survey Corps**.
*   **Relationships:** Eren’s closest friend; he represents the "dreamer" who wants to see the ocean, contrasting Eren’s "fighter" persona.

### **3. Key Supporting Leaders**
#### **Levi Ackerman**
*   **Abilities:** Known as **"Humanity's Strongest Soldier."** His Ackerman bloodline combined with years of experience makes him an invincible combatant, capable of taking down the Beast Titan single-handedly.
*   **Role:** Captain of the Special Operations Squad; mentor and "jailer" to Eren.
*   **Relationships:** Deeply loyal to Erwin Smith. He views his subordinates as family and carries the burden of being the sole survivor of many missions.

#### **Erwin Smith**
*   **Abilities:** Master strategist and charismatic orator. He is willing to sacrifice anything—including his own humanity and his soldiers' lives—to uncover the truth of the world.
*   **Role:** **13th Commander of the Survey Corps**.
*   **Relationships:** Shares a bond of absolute trust with Levi. His personal motivation is a childhood dream to prove his father's theories about the Walls right.

### **4. The Antagonists**
The series is famous for humanizing its villains, making the "antagonist" role subjective.

*   **Reiner Braun (The Armored Titan):** Initially a "big brother" figure to Eren, he is revealed as a Marleyan spy. He suffers from a split personality due to the guilt of his actions. He serves as the primary foil to Eren.
*   **Zeke Yeager (The Beast Titan):** Eren’s half-brother and a "War Chief" of Marley. He seeks to use the Founding Titan to make Eldians sterile, believing it is the only "merciful" way to end the cycle of war.
*   **Annie Leonhart (The Female Titan):** A stoic, highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant who infiltrates the Walls to retrieve the Founding Titan.
*   **King Fritz & Marleyan Government:** Represent the systemic "villains"—the historical and political forces that perpetuate the cycle of hatred and titan-warfare.

### **Summary of Dynamics**
| Character | Primary Role | Key Ability | Relationship to Eren |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eren** | Protagonist $\rightarrow$ Antagonist | Founding/Attack Titan | N/A (Self) |

| **Zeke** | Mastermind / Antagonist | Beast Titan / Royal Blood | Half-Brother / Ally-turned-Enemy |

## Factions
The world of *Attack on Titan* is defined by a complex web of shifting alliances, historical grievances, and military organizations. The factions are primarily divided between the inhabitants of **Paradis Island** (the "Walldians") and the **Marleyan Empire**, though the conflict eventually expands to include the entire world.

### **1. The Military of Paradis Island (The Walls)**
Before the truth of the world was revealed, the military was divided into three distinct branches, all overseen by a Commander-in-Chief (Darius Zackly).

*   **The Survey Corps (Scout Regiment):** The elite branch tasked with Titan combat and external exploration. Known for the "Wings of Freedom" insignia, they are the most skilled but suffer the highest casualties. Key members include Erwin Smith, Levi Ackerman, Hange Zoë, and Eren Yeager.
*   **The Garrison Regiment:** The largest branch, responsible for maintaining the Walls and protecting the civilian population. They specialize in defensive warfare and cannon usage. Led by Dot Pixis.
*   **The Military Police Brigade:** The most prestigious branch, as only the top 10 graduates of each training year can join. They maintain order within the inner walls and serve as the King’s guard. They are often depicted as corrupt and lazy.
*   **The Training Corps:** The entry-level branch where all recruits spend three years learning ODM (Omni-Directional Mobility) gear and combat before choosing a permanent branch.

### **2. The Marleyan Empire**
Marley is a global superpower that overthrew the ancient Eldian Empire. They maintain their dominance through the "Power of the Titans."

*   **The Warrior Unit:** An elite group of Eldian children raised in Marleyan internment zones to inherit the Nine Titans. They are "Honorary Marleyans" who serve as Marley's primary weapons. Key members include Reiner Braun (Armored), Bertholdt Hoover (Colossal), Annie Leonhart (Female), and Zeke Yeager (Beast).
*   **Public Security Authorities:** The internal police force of Marley, responsible for monitoring Eldians in internment zones (like Liberio) and punishing "Restorationists" by turning them into Pure Titans.
*   **The Tybur Family:** An influential Eldian noble family living in Marley. Despite being Eldian, they hold immense political power and were the secret "true" rulers of Marley for a century. They possess the War Hammer Titan.

### **3. Political & Rebel Factions**
*   **The Yeagerists:** A radical insurgent faction that emerged late in the series. They are loyal to Eren Yeager and believe that the "Rumbling" (using Wall Titans to destroy the world) is the only way to ensure Paradis' survival. Led by Floch Forster.
*   **Anti-Marleyan Volunteers:** A group of soldiers from nations conquered by Marley who infiltrated the Marleyan military to help Zeke Yeager. Their goal was to overthrow Marley, though their leader, Yelena, was secretly working toward Zeke’s "Euthanization Plan."
*   **Eldian Restorationists:** An underground movement within Marley (including Eren’s father, Grisha) that sought to overthrow Marley and restore the Eldian Empire using the Founding Titan.
*   **The Alliance:** A desperate, last-minute coalition formed to stop Eren Yeager’s Rumbling. It consists of the remaining Survey Corps members (Mikasa, Armin, Levi, Jean, Connie) and the surviving Marleyan Warriors (Reiner, Annie, Pieck, Falco, Gabi).

### **4. World Powers & Alliances**
*   **The Eldian Empire (Ancient):** The historical superpower that ruled the world for 2,000 years using the Nine Titans. It collapsed during the "Great Titan War" when the 145th King, Karl Fritz, retreated to Paradis Island.
*   **Mid-East Allied Forces:** A coalition of nations that fought a four-year war against Marley. They utilized advanced technology (like anti-Titan artillery) to prove that the era of Titan dominance was ending.
*   **The Global Allied Fleet:** An unprecedented military alliance of nearly every nation on Earth, organized by Marley and the Tybur family. Their goal was to launch a scorched-earth invasion of Paradis to eliminate the "Eldian threat" once and for all.
*   **Hizuru:** An eastern nation (inspired by Japan) and the only country to maintain a friendly, albeit opportunistic, relationship with Paradis. They are interested in Paradis' "Iceburst Stone" resources and the lineage of Mikasa Ackerman, who is related to their lost royalty.

### **5. Summary of Enemies**
*   **Early Series:** The "Titans" were the primary enemy of humanity.
*   **Mid-Series:** The "Warriors" (Reiner/Bertholdt/Annie) and the corrupt Royal Government of Paradis became the enemies.
*   **Late Series:** Marley and the Global Alliance became the enemies of Paradis, while Eren Yeager and the Yeagerists eventually became the enemies of the rest of the world (and the "Alliance" protagonists).

## Locations
The world of *Attack on Titan* (*Shingeki no Kyojin*) is set on a planet that serves as a geographically inverted and mirrored version of Earth. In this setting, the "North" is actually the South of our world, and the map is flipped horizontally.

### **1. World Geography & The "Upside-Down" Map**
The global geography of *Attack on Titan* is a direct reflection of real-world continents:
*   **Paradis Island:** Corresponds to the island of **Madagascar**. It is the primary setting for the first three seasons.
*   **Marleyan Continent:** Corresponds to **Africa and Europe**. Marley is the dominant global superpower that occupies most of this landmass.
*   **Hizuru:** An island nation to the East (corresponding to **Japan**) that was once an ally of the Eldian Empire.
*   **Mid-East Allied Forces:** A coalition of nations (corresponding to the **Middle East and Ottoman Empire**) that fought a four-year war against Marley.

---

### **2. Paradis Island: The Three Walls**
For over 100 years, the remnants of the Eldian people lived within three concentric walls on Paradis Island to protect themselves from Titans. Each wall is roughly 50 meters tall.

*   **Wall Maria (Outermost):** The largest wall, with a radius of 480km. It was breached in the year 845 by the Colossal and Armored Titans.
    *   **Shiganshina District:** Located on the southern edge; the hometown of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin.
*   **Wall Rose (Middle):** Located 100km inside Wall Maria.
    *   **Trost District:** The southern district where the second Titan attack occurs five years after the fall of Maria.
    *   **Karanes District:** Located on the eastern edge; often used as a starting point for Survey Corps expeditions.
    *   **Utopia District:** The northern district of Wall Rose.
*   **Wall Sina (Innermost):** The smallest and most prestigious wall, housing the elite, the nobility, and the King.
    *   **Mitras:** The royal capital and the seat of the government.
    *   **Stohess District:** Located on the eastern edge; the site of the final battle against the Female Titan.
    *   **The Underground City:** A massive, impoverished cavern beneath Mitras where people live in permanent shadow (Levi Ackerman’s birthplace).

---

### **3. Important Locations on Paradis (Outside the Walls)**
*   **Forest of Giant Trees:** A forest containing trees that grow over 80 meters tall. It serves as a strategic location for the Survey Corps because Titans cannot easily navigate the dense canopy, and soldiers can use Omni-Directional Mobility (ODM) gear effectively.
*   **Utgard Castle:** An ancient, ruined castle near Wall Rose where the 104th Training Corps was besieged by Titans during the night.
*   **The Reiss Chapel & Underground Cavern:** A hidden crystal cavern beneath a chapel where the Royal Family passed down the Founding Titan for generations.
*   **The Sea (The Ocean):** For most of the series, the ocean is a myth to the people of the Walls. It is located at the edge of Paradis Island and separates it from the Marleyan mainland.

---

### **4. The Marleyan Empire**
Marley is a technologically advanced nation that uses the "Power of the Titans" to maintain global dominance.
*   **Liberio Internment Zone:** A walled-off ghetto within a Marleyan city where Eldians are forced to live. It is the home of the "Warrior Unit" (Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, etc.).
*   **Fort Slava:** A massive mountain fortress located on a peninsula. It was the site of the final battle in the Marley-Mid-East War.
*   **Odiha:** A coastal city in the south of the Marleyan continent where the Survey Corps and their allies prepared a flying boat to stop the Rumbling.
*   **Fort Salta:** A Marleyan military research base located on a high plateau (corresponding to the **Atlas Mountains**). It serves as the setting for the series' final confrontation.

---

### **5. Metaphysical & Ancient Locations**
*   **The Paths:** A timeless, desert-like dimension that connects all "Subjects of Ymir" to the Founding Titan. It is where the soul of Ymir Fritz resides and where Titans are "built" out of sand.
*   **The Tree of the Source:** An ancient, massive tree where a young Ymir Fritz fell into a pool of water and came into contact with the "source of all living matter," gaining the power of the Titans. Its location is roughly in the region that would become Marley.

## Arcs, Sequels, Adaptations, Recent
*Attack on Titan* (*Shingeki no Kyojin*), created by Hajime Isayama, has evolved from a dark fantasy manga into a global cultural phenomenon. Below is a detailed breakdown of its story arcs, adaptations, spinoffs, and recent developments as of early 2026.

### 1. Major Story Arcs & Timeline
The series follows a chronological progression from a "man vs. monster" survival story to a complex geopolitical and philosophical war.

*   **The Fall of Shiganshina (Year 845):** The Colossal and Armored Titans breach Wall Maria. Eren Yeager’s mother is killed, prompting his vow to "eradicate every last Titan."
*   **104th Training Corps Arc (Year 847–850):** Eren, Mikasa, and Armin join the military. This arc establishes the core cast and the mechanics of the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME).
*   **Battle of Trost District (Year 850):** The Colossal Titan reappears. Eren discovers his ability to transform into a Titan, which leads to the first human victory as he seals the breach with a boulder.
*   **The Female Titan / 57th Expedition (Year 850):** The Survey Corps ventures outside the walls. They encounter a sentient Female Titan (Annie Leonhart), leading to a brutal showdown within the Stohess District.
*   **Clash of the Titans Arc:** The identities of the Armored (Reiner) and Colossal (Bertholdt) Titans are revealed. Eren discovers the "Coordinate" power (Founding Titan) during a desperate rescue mission.
*   **Uprising Arc:** A political shift where the Survey Corps overthrows the corrupt royal government. Historia Reiss is crowned Queen, and the truth about the Reiss family and Titan inheritance is revealed.
*   **Return to Shiganshina Arc:** The Survey Corps successfully retakes Wall Maria. They defeat the Beast, Armored, and Colossal Titans at a massive cost (including Erwin Smith’s death). They reach the Yeager basement and learn the truth: humanity exists beyond the walls in a nation called Marley.
*   **Marley Arc (Year 854):** The perspective shifts to Marley. Eren launches a surprise attack on Liberio, stealing the War Hammer Titan and declaring war on the world.
*   **War for Paradis / The Rumbling:** Eren betrays his friends to activate the "Rumbling," releasing millions of Colossal Titans to flatten the world. The "Alliance" (former enemies and friends) unites to stop him.

### 2. Sequels, Spinoffs, and Prequels
While the main story is complete, several related works expand the lore:

*   **Prequels:**
    *   ***Attack on Titan: Before the Fall***: Set 70 years before Eren’s era, it explores the invention of the VME and the first recorded Titan kills.
    *   ***No Regrets***: A two-volume manga/OVA focusing on Levi Ackerman’s life as a criminal in the Underground and how he was recruited by Erwin Smith.
*   **Spinoffs:**
    *   ***Lost Girls***: Focuses on side stories for Annie Leonhart and Mikasa Ackerman.
    *   ***Junior High / High School***: Parody series where the characters attend school in a Titan-free (or Titan-integrated) world.
*   **Continuity Note:** *Before the Fall* and *No Regrets* are generally considered canon to the world-building, while the school spinoffs are strictly non-canon "what-if" scenarios.

### 3. Manga vs. Anime: Key Differences
The anime is a faithful adaptation but includes several notable changes:

*   **Pacing & Structure:** The **Uprising Arc** was significantly condensed in the anime (Season 3, Part 1) at Isayama’s request to make it more action-oriented.
*   **Eren’s "Berserk" Mode:** In the Season 1 finale, Eren enters a flaming "Berserk" state against Annie. This does **not** happen in the manga; he remains in control of his Titan.
*   **Characterization:** The manga portrays Mikasa as more independent and vocal, whereas the anime initially leaned heavily into her "Eren-centric" dialogue.
*   **The Ending:** The anime’s final conversation between Eren and Armin (The Final Chapters Special 2) was expanded with new dialogue to better explain Eren’s motivations and the tragedy of his choices, addressing some criticisms of the manga's original conclusion.

### 4. Latest Updates & 2026 Events
Though the manga ended in 2021 and the anime in 2023, the franchise remains active:

*   **"The Last Attack" Movie (2024/2025):** A theatrical omnibus film combining the final two specials into a 145-minute feature. It premiered in Japan in late 2024 and hit international theaters (US/UK) in **February 2025**. It features enhanced visuals and a **new post-credits scene** showing the world long after the Rumbling.
*   **Volume 35 & "Bad Boy" (2024):** As part of the *Shingeki Fly* art book, Isayama released an 18-page one-shot titled *Bad Boy*. It is a prequel focusing on **Levi’s childhood** and how he awakened his Ackerman powers.
*   **2026 "Beyond the Walls" World Tour:** A massive orchestral concert tour celebrating the series' music is touring the U.S. and Europe throughout 2026.
*   **Future Projects:** In late 2025, producers hinted at new "murder mystery" games and potential future film collaborations, though no official "Season 5" or sequel series has been announced. The series is currently in its "legacy phase," focusing on high-end art books, remasters, and live events.
