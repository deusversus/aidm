## [CHARACTERS] Aura
IntroductionGallery

**Aura** ｢アウラ, *Aura*?｣, also known as **Aura the Guillotine** ｢断 (だん) 頭 (とう) 台 (だい) のアウラ, *Dantōdai no Aura*?｣ is one of the Seven Sages of Destruction directly serving the Demon King. Using her signature magic, Auserlese, she weighs the mana of her opponent's soul as well as her own on her Scales of Obedience, granting the soul with more mana complete control over the other's body. 

## Personality]

Aura is, as a demon, an articulate monster who is individualistic and harbors no sense of empathy. Even though she has her executioners as subordinates, she was not distressed in the slightest to learn of their demise. Typical of her race, she has strong confidence in the superiority of her magic and seems to enjoy battles where she thinks she has the upper hand. However, Aura has also shown to be a cautious person. When she is up against enemies whom she could not beat, such as the Hero Party, she will opt to choose to retreat instead of trying to face them head-on. This tendency contributed to her survival when the Demon King was defeated. She also makes sure to check for signs of mana instability in a mage and is aware of the history of renowned mages that she fights, such as Frieren.

## Appearance]

Aura has magenta hair that reaches to the middle of her back. Her hair is gathered in two large pigtails tied at the shoulder. The remaining hair in the pigtails is sectioned off into three braids. Aura has dark blue eyes and two light brown horns protruding through her hair. She wears a dark, sleeveless bodice with white trimmings that has a cutout at her navel and a ruffled white skirt underneath. A magenta skirt tail is fastened at her waist with gold buttons, complementing the golden accessories at her neck. Her opera gloves are the same color as her bodice and wrap around her upper arm in a series of threads, and her boots are striped and reach her mid thigh. 

### Scales of Obedience]

The **Scales of Obedience** ｢服 (ふく) 従 (じゅう) の天 (てん) 秤 (びん) , *Fukujū no Tenbin*?｣ are a magical item used by Aura. They resemble a libra with two hemispherical scales balanced on either side. With her spell of obedience, Auserlese, Aura places her own soul and her target’s soul onto the scales to measure their mana pools.

## Synopsis]

### History]

Aura became a Sage of Destruction more than five hundred years ago and built an army out of the people whom she subjugated with her magic. She is famous for decapitating every person she successfully controlled upon finding out that a person with sufficient willpower could partially defy her magic, granting her the title of "Aura the Guillotine." At some point, she and all Sages of Destruction were called to assist in a coming battle against the Hero of the South under the command of Schlacht. She survived the encounter, though at the cost of three of her fellow Sages and Schlacht himself. When she faced the Hero Party, she suffered the loss of a significant portion of her undead army, was injured by Himmel, and was forced to retreat. The party would go on to defeat the Demon King. Afterwards, Aura remained in hiding until Himmel's passing.

After Himmel's death, Aura reappeared and began to wage a war in order to take over Graf Granat's Domain in the Northern Lands. This led to a bitter conflict with the humans there since and resulted in the death of Graf Granat's son after he was enlisted to fight in the war.

### Aura the Guillotine Arc]

Twenty-eight years post Himmel's death, Aura, seemingly tired of war, sends three of her executioners, Lügner, Linie, and Draht, as messengers to negotiate for peace with Graf Granat by the time Frieren's Party arrives. However, her real intention was to lower the Graf's guard and persuade him to disable the powerful barrier surrounding his domain, effectively giving her and her army free access.

However, Frieren kills Draht, one of Aura's executioners, and proceeds to confront her outside the town. After a short battle against her undead army, Aura finally decides to use her Scales of Obedience, putting both of their souls on it to see which individual possesses more mana. At first, the scale appears to favor her soul, but it suddenly starts shifting to Frieren. Frieren reveals her mana concealment strategy, and Aura is unable to comprehend that a mage would limit their mana their entire life just to deceive demons. Aura emphasizes that she has lived for over five hundred years, but Frieren reveals that she has lived for more than a thousand years and reveals her true mana output, which is much higher than Aura's. This leads to Aura losing to her own submission magic, giving Frieren free rein over Aura's body. Frieren then orders Aura to kill herself, to which she is forced to comply by cutting off her own head.

## Abilities]

As one of Seven Sages of Destruction Aura is a demon possessing magic that surpasses humanity's knowledge and reason.

- **Immense Mana Output**: Being a great demon that lived for over five-hundred years and has devoted most of her time to training, Aura possesses colossal amounts of mana. Until her defeat at the hands of Frieren, during her lifetime she never weighed on her scales a soul that had more mana than her own.

### Spells]

- **Spell of Obedience: Auserlese** ｢服従させる魔法 (アゼリューゼ) , *Azeryūze*?｣: Aura's unique magic allows her to weigh her soul against her target's using the Scales of Obedience. If Aura's mana exceeds that of her opponent, she gains permanent control over their body. However, this control can be temporarily broken by someone with an unyielding will. To counteract this, Aura often resolves the issue by beheading those under her control. While Aura's magic is incredibly powerful, it carries significant risk. If her opponent possesses more mana, they can permanently take control of her body, making the use of the Scales a high-stakes gamble for Aura.

## [CHARACTERS] Blei
IntroductionGallery

**Blei** ｢ブライ, *Burai*?｣ is a mage who participates in the First-Class Mage Exam. In the first stage of the exam, he is placed in the Seventeenth Party, alongside Edel and Dünste.

## Personality]

Not much is known about Blei's personality. Throughout the First-Class Mage Exam, he listens to Edel's orders without complaint and follows her around Äußerst after the first stage of the exam. He is willing to question authorities, as shown when he asks Sense whether she intends for them to all fail the second stage of the exam. He is level-headed in stressful situations. When their party is cornered by Sense's Spiegel clone, Blei is the one to bring up that they cannot conceal their mana forever, and is also the one to ask whether Edel's hypnosis magic would be able to work on Sense. Though Edel brings up that Blei cannot imagine defeating Sense, he remains optimistic that with Edel's hypnosis magic, the situation is not hopeless.

When Blei and Dünste attempt to escape from Sense's Spiegel clone, Blei chooses to hold the Spiegel back himself and give Dünste an opportunity to escape, showing his self-sacrificial nature.

## Appearance]

Blei is a tall, bald mage with a goatee. He wears long, light-colored robes tied with a rope at the waist and a long black overcoat. Around his neck, he wears a light colored cowl.

## Synopsis]

### First-Class Mage Exam Arc (First Stage)]

Blei is one of the participants in the First-Class Mage Exam held in Äußerst. In the first stage of the exam, he is placed in the Seventeenth Party alongside Edel and Dünste. They are one of the parties who have the idea of waiting by the lake for Stille to appear. When Lawine freezes the lake over, he questions what her party is up to. After the lake is frozen over, not realizing that a Stille will not approach a body of water that has been disturbed by so much mana, he listens to Edel's instructions to melt the lake, and attempts to do so by shooting a continuous stream of fire at the lake. It is unknown how the Seventeenth Party fares for the rest of the first stage, but they are eventually able to capture a Stille that lands on a collapsed Dünste's back, thus allowing them to successfully pass the first stage of the exam.

Between the first and second stage of the exam, Blei and Dünste are seen walking around Äußerst with Edel when they receive the note with details on the second exam. 

### First-Class Mage Exam Arc (Second Stage)]

In the second stage of the exam, after Sense explains the conditions to pass—reach the innermost depths of the Ruins of the King's Tomb—Blei brings up that the ruins are an unmapped dungeon from which many adventurers have never returned alive. He questions if Sense intends for everyone to fail, but he is chastised by Sense who states that a first-class mage must keep going forward even when the path is unexplored or untrodden. After Sense begins the exam, he, Edel, and Dünste enter the dungeon together. They make it partway through the dungeon, but then they are cornered by the Spiegel clone of Sense. As they hunch behind a pillar together, Edel expresses that it's a miracle they've managed to escape from everything so far. Blei questions what the Sense clone is, and brings up that they can only conceal their mana and hide for so long, meaning they have no choice but to fight the clone of Sense soon. Edel states that Blei cannot imagine defeating Sense, nor can he even fight in the dungeon, but he remains hopeful that Edel's hypnosis magic could work on the clone. When the clone proves to not have a mind, thus rendering Edel's magic useless, he stays behind to buy time for Dünste to escape, then breaks his escape bottle golem. Afterwards, he is seen gathered outside with the rest of the mages that failed the second stage of the exam.

## Abilities]

Little is known about Blei's abilities. However, his participation in the First-Class Mage Exam confirms that he holds at least the rank of Fifth-Class Mage. He manages to hold off Sense's Spiegel clone long enough for Dünste to escape, though Edel states that Blei is unable to fight within the Ruins of the King's Tomb. This indicates that Blei uses modern magic, which manipulates or changes elements that are nearby, and those elements cannot be found within the dungeon.

### Spells]

- **Unnamed Fire Spell** ｢炎 (ほのお) の魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Honō no mahō*?｣: In the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, Blei casts a fire spell in order to try to melt the lake that Lawine has frozen over.

- **Defensive magic** ｢防 (ぼう) 御 (ぎょ) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Bōgyo mahō*?｣: The standard defensive spell commonly employed by modern mages. Blei casts it alongside Dünste to shield themselves and Edel within a protective sphere against Sense’s Spiegel Clone.

- **Mana-driven telekinesis:** Blei, alongside Dünste, is shown lifting and hurling slabs of rock using his staff against Sense's Spiegel clone.

## [CHARACTERS] Böse
IntroductionGallery

**Böse** ｢ベーゼ, *Bēze*?｣, also known as **Böse the Immortal** ｢不 (ふ) 死 (し) なるベーゼ, *Fushinaru bēze*?｣, was one of the Seven Sages of Destruction. Böse, along with the other Sages of Destruction, fought against the Hero of the South. Though he survived the encounter, he was ultimately defeated by the Hero Party.

## Personality]

Not much is known about Böse's personality. Like all other demons, he was proud of his own magic. This lead him to be especially wary of Frieren after she broke through his insurmountable barrier and caused him to disregard the rest of the Hero Party. When Himmel struck him fatally from behind, Böse reacted in disbelief. According to Himmel's assessment, Böse's downfall was due to his underestimation of humanity.

## Appearance]

Böse has long, choppy, light colored hair that stretches to his lower back. Like all demons, he has two horns protruding from his head. Böse's horns are thick and point downwards. They curve upwards and then downwards before tapering at the tip. Böse is seen wearing a helmet covering his entire head, large pauldrons with a flower motif decorating them, and a gorget protecting his neck and chest. He also wears a long, dark cape. 

## Synopsis]

### History]

At some point, Böse ascended to being one of the Seven Sages of Destruction. He was known as Böse the Immortal. He fought against the Hero of the South along with the other Sages of Destruction and Schlacht the Omniscient. Böse survived the battle.

At some point during the ten-year journey of the Hero Party, Böse confronted the party and trapped them within his barrier magic. However, through their combined efforts, the Hero Party was able to break Böse's barrier. As Frieren was the one who ultimately dispelled the barrier, this caused Böse to focus his attention on her throughout the ensuing battle, which gave Himmel the opportunity to attack and kill him from behind. Böse expressed shock at his defeat.

After his defeat, stories would begin to circulate about Böse's defeat at the hands of the Hero Party, some of which would later be compiled into books and circulated throughout the Northern Lands.

## Abilities]

As one of Seven Sages of Destruction, Böse is a demon possessing magic that surpasses humanity's knowledge and reason.

### Spells]

- **Barrier magic** ｢結 (けっ) 界 (かい) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Kekkai mahō*?｣: Böse could create extremely powerful barriers, and these barriers were considered by Frieren to be unbreakable by humankind. His magic enclosed a space with barriers composed of square grids. However, his barriers were not completely impervious to physical attacks and could be chipped by an exceptionally strong Hero or Warrior. Additionally, Frieren was ultimately able to break his barrier with support from the Hero Party.

## [CHARACTERS] Clematis
IntroductionGallery

**This article is currently under active development.**

*This article is expected to be high-traffic among editors, which can result in frequent changes. This may be due to its relevance in ongoing arcs or editors focusing on developing certain pages.*
*Feel free to help Frieren Wiki by **expanding it**. Please be sure to adhere to the Editor's Guidelines, Manual of Style, and Image Policy.*

**Clematis** ｢クレマティス, *Kurematisu*?｣ is a human priest and a Shadow Warrior. He is assigned to the mission to assassinate the Great Mage Serie. He works at a church in the Imperial Capital, Eiseberg.

## Personality]

Clematis appears calm and often smiling, but his working style is very methodical. He prioritizes efficiency over sentiment and treats comrades as assets to complete missions. Examples include Iris recalling him healing her and immediately sending her back to the front, and Clematis describing Wehrlos as their greatest asset and stating that he should be used in the most advantageous way. 

Clematis also trained Iris and Gazelle in both combat and observation-and-imitation, but denies any paternal intent, stating he only wanted capable pawns. As a result, he is openly disliked by his colleagues and apprentices, including Lore and Iris. This is something he himself acknowledges, and even Wehrlos remarks that he understands why.

Clematis refuses to bring anyone who would slow down the party, and while he accepts sacrifices to secure victory, he cannot tolerate wasting a life. He applies the same logic to himself, saying he is at ease with dying as a pawn because he has trained Lore as his successor and trusts she can handle the aftermath.

Despite this, Clematis is pious, telling Lore that material wealth is meaningless compared to faith. Wolf, however, remarks that Clematis merely has a silver tongue and is simply being thrifty. In addition, Clematis prepares simplified mission lists phrased so clearly that even a child could understand, which he uses as practice for writing teaching materials for an orphanage.

## Appearance]

Clematis is a tall man with light green eyes and light blonde hair that falls neatly across his forehead. He wears traditional clerical attire, consisting of a long, buttoned robe, as well as a necklace bearing the crest of the Goddess of Creation. Draped over his shoulders is a white stole that extends down to below his knees. He also wears black boots.

## Synopsis]

### Foundation Festival Arc]

After Löwe instructs Schritt to notify the other Shadow Warriors of the new mission to assassinate the Great Mage Serie, the message passes through several informants before reaching the librarian Routine, who relays it to Clematis. Clematis then shares the details with the nun Lore. The following day, Clematis attends the Shadow Warriors's final meeting to review the mission. After Schritt says she forgot to notify her brother Kreis, Clematis distributes the mission details to everyone present so the meeting can proceed.

After the meeting, Clematis heads back to his church. Later, he receives a report from Iris and Routine, who inspected the tunnel from the era of the Unified Empire, informing him that the escape route to the Imperial Palace is unusable. Wehrlos then investigates the route himself, successfully swims through it, and goes to Clematis’s church to share his findings. Clematis concludes that Wehrlos is the only one capable of using the route.

While there, Clematis and Wehrlos work out a plan to move Wehrlos, whom Clematis calls their greatest asset, behind enemy lines. After their discussion over tea, Wehrlos leaves, but quickly returns with a gravely injured cat, hoping Clematis can save it. Clematis tells him it is too late and offers a prayer, but Wehrlos replies that it is not necessary.

## [CHARACTERS] Demon King
The **Demon King** ｢魔 (ま) 王 (おう) , *Maō*?｣ was the leader of the Demon King's Army, and the defeat of this being was the primary objective of the Hero Party's ten-year quest. For over a thousand years, the Demon King waged war against the human realms of the continent before ultimately being slain by Frieren and her companions. Despite the Demon King's importance in the world, relatively little is known about this figure so far.

## Personality]

Not much is known about the Demon King's personality, however, while most demons value individuality, the Demon King notably fostered order among demons and was able to maintain loyalty among demonkind. Like Macht, the Demon King desired coexistence amongst humans and demons. In pursuit of this goal, the Demon King resorted to mass killings of humans in an attempt to better understand their way of thinking, ultimately reducing humanity's sphere of influence by a third.

According to Solitär, the Demon King, like Schlacht and Macht, showed traits unusual for demons, yet they all still shared the inescapable nature of a demon. As implied by Frieren, and much like Macht, the Demon King’s desire to understand humans and "coexist" led to extensive study and research of humanity. Part of these studies involved researching other biological life, during which the Demon King developed the theory of "convergent evolution" to explain the difference between mammals and aquatic life forms, a theory later shared with Solitär.

## Appearance]

Not much is known about the Demon King's appearance. The Demon King appeared to wear full plate armor and, like many demons, possessed a pair of horns.

## Synopsis]

### History]

According to Heiter, ever since demons first appeared in human history and war with humanity began, the Demon King had reigned over demonkind for more than a thousand years by the time of the Hero Party’s journey.

Around a millennium before the era of the Hero Himmel, the Demon King ordered the massacre of the elven population. Frieren’s village was destroyed by Basalt the Throne and his forces, leaving her as the sole survivor. Ironically, this event led to Frieren meeting Flamme, who would go on to train her and entrust her with the mission of killing the Demon King, a mission she fulfilled many centuries later.

Shortly before Himmel visited Frieren, the Hero of the South launched a one-year campaign against the Demon King's Army, shattering its front line. In response, the Demon King tasked Schlacht the Omniscient with eliminating the hero. Acting on that command, Schlacht assembled all of the Seven Sages of Destruction to confront him. The ensuing battle left Schlacht and three of the Seven Sages dead, along with the Hero of the South.

About seven years later, the Demon King ordered several demons to keep the Monument of the Goddess under close watch, believing that a traveler from nearly a century in the future would arrive through it. Three years after that, the Hero Party, composed of Eisen, Frieren, Heiter, and Himmel, reached the Demon King's Castle and fought the Demon King, ultimately slaying the ruler of demonkind who had plagued humanity for more than a millennium.

## Abilities]

Not much is known about the Demon King's abilities. However, it is implied that the Demon King was exceptionally powerful. When recalling the Hero Party's journey, Eisen mentioned that a lot happened in the Demon King's castle, indicating a difficult fight. The Demon King also assessed that a consciousness from eighty years in the future would arrive via the Goddess’s Monument, though whether that insight came from a special ability, prior knowledge, or another source remains unknown.

- **Immense mana output**: Given that demon societal hierarchies are based on the amount of mana a demon has, and all demons appeared to answer to the Demon King, it can be assumed that the Demon King had significantly more mana than any other demon.

- **Mana detection**: The Demon King is noted by Serie to have possessed incredible mana sensitivity and detection. Unlike the majority of demons, including members of the Seven Sages of Destruction and other Greater Demons, the Demon King was able to immediately recognize that Frieren had been suppressing her mana output the very moment they met.

## [CHARACTERS] Denken
IntroductionSynopsisRelationshipsGallery

**Denken** ｢デンケン, *Denken*?｣ is an Imperial Mage and a first-class mage. Born in the Weise Region, he lost both of his parents by demon attacks and was raised by Glück, the feudal lord of Weise. When he was young, he was the apprentice of Macht, who was serving as the personal mage of Glück's family. Because of his wife's frail condition, Denken became a mage in the Imperial army and tried to gain power and influence in hopes of saving her life, but unfortunately she passed away before he could. After the death of his wife and the formation of the Golden Land, Denken had delayed returning to his hometown until it was swallowed up by the Golden Land. Since only first-class mages are allowed to enter the Golden Land, Denken took the First-Class Mage Exam at the same time as Frieren and Fern. He is the oldest examinee that passed that year's exam.

## Personality]

As an Imperial Mage, Denken is renowned to be a cunning and ruthless politician who reigned supreme in a struggle of power at the Imperial Capital. However, in truth he is quite personable and makes connections with others even to their reluctance, such as going out of his way to approach Richter outside of the First-Class Mage Exam. He is also a rare mage who values coordination and cooperation rather than acting on his own, and was willing to go out of his way to secure allies. Unlike most mages, he does not put too much emphasis in reaching greater heights of power by all means. He believes that the value of magic lies in the pursuit of the magic itself, an opinion which Frieren is in agreement with.

Denken is also a competent leader. He is a careful and contemplative person who keeps his calm and analyzes the situation. In the first stage of the exam, he is the first to figure out Frieren's strategy and coordinated his team's conduct to moderate success. He also manages to form a team for the second stage of the exam, where he expresses dismay at the lack of cooperative spirit among other examinees. During their preparation to fight Macht, Denken is ready to wait for at least three years for Frieren to finish analyzing Macht's Diagoldze, exemplifying both his patience and his persistence.

Lernen, who is his long time friend, describes Denken as a talented and passionate man who stood up for him until the end when he was expelled from his position in the Imperial Army. Although his current conduct may not indicate it, Serie remarks that Denken still retains his passion and vigor in their interview and is impressed enough to let him pass the third stage of the First-Class Mage Exam. He shows he is willing to go to great lengths to get what he wants, namely when he is ready to engage in a fistfight in order to steal a Stille and pass the first stage of the exam. He is also willing to aim for feats which exceed his abilities, such as challenging Frieren in the first stage of the exam, contemplating how to fight Serie, and attempting to defeat Macht, the most powerful Sage of Destruction and whom was also his master.

For most of his life, Denken is weighed down by the death of his wife and is fearful of remembering the happy times he has spent with her. It is why he has delayed returning to visit his hometown for so long that it has become a restricted area due to the Golden Land's expansion. However, the happy memories he has in his hometown with her becomes the impetus for his quest to defeat Macht and save his hometown.

Denken has a soft spot for young adults like Laufen, Fern, and Stark since he never had children nor grandchildren of his own. He treats and spoils them before parting ways after the exam.

## Appearance]

Denken is an elderly man with brown hair and a long, thick beard. He wears a monocle on his left eye. He is commonly seen wearing a long, black robe with white collars.

## Abilities]

Denken is a powerful mage who achieved the rank of first-class mage, a title that less than fifty people have ever been able to achieve prior to the First-Class Mage Exam he participated in.

- **Mana detection**: Denken is talented at detecting mana, being the only member of his party that could sense the faint traces of mana in the water left by Kanne during the first stage of the first-class mage exam. Additionally, he was able to detect the moment Frieren used a binding spell to find her on the examination grounds.

- **Keen intellect**: Denken is a cunning man who was able to thrive in the world of politics for many years. His experience is shown during the first exam, where he successfully dissected the second party's plan and decided that the best course of action was to steal the Stille from them at a crucial moment. He was also the only one in his team who realized the existance of traps set up by the Geisel monsters.

- **Hand-to-hand combat**: Beyond Denken's magic expertise, he is capable of engaging an opponent in physical combat.

### Spells]

- **Tornado Winds: Waldgose** ｢竜巻を起こす魔法 (ヴァルドゴーゼ) , *Varudogōze*?｣: Denken is able to create a tornado that envelops his target.

- **Wind becomes Hellfire: Daosdorg** ｢風を業火に変える魔法 (ダオスドルグ) , *Daosudorugu*?｣: Denken turns a source of wind into a blaze of fire surrounding the target. He used this as a follow-up attack after Waldgose against Frieren.

- **Lights of Judgement: Catastravia** ｢裁きの光を放つ魔法 (カタストラーヴィア) , *Katasutorāvia*?｣: Denken summons numerous arrows of light directed at his target. Upon contact, they form a barrage of large explosions.

- **Offensive magic: Zoltraak** ｢一般攻撃魔法 (ゾルトラーク) , *Zorutorāku*?｣: Denken is competent with Zoltraak, and he can shoot a single, concentrated blast or multiple blasts at a target at immense speed. Denken claims it is a fundamental spell for a mage and has been improved upon for more than half a century. He has mastered this spell to such a great level he is capable of casting a highly concentrated Zoltraak from his bare hands.

- **Defensive magic** ｢防 (ぼう) 御 (ぎょ) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Bōgyo mahō*?｣: Like most modern mages, Denken is capable of casting defensive magic in the form of a hexagonal protective barriers. His defenses are good enough to block multiple blasts of Zoltraak from Frieren.

- **Flight magic**: Allows the caster to levitate and maneuver through the air. Denken is capable of engaging powerful mages such as Macht in an aerial battle.

- **Curse Reversal Magic: Mistilziela** ｢呪い返しの魔法 (ミスティルジーラ) , *Misutirujīra*?｣: Mistilziela is a spell that reflects anything it perceives to be a curse back at the one who cast it. However, it uses a colossal amount of mana, comparable to the mana needed to erect omnidirectional defense magic. It also requires a hundred years of practice to learn, making it impossible for a human to learn through ordinary means. After passing the First-Class Mage Exam and being granted the title of first-class mage, Denken requests this spell from Serie for his privilege, and she transfers both the spell and her hundred years of training to him. Denken chose this magic particularly to counter Macht's Diagoldze once they fight.

## [CHARACTERS] Draht
IntroductionGallery

**Draht** ｢ドラート, *Dorāto*?｣ was a demon who served Aura the Guillotine. He infiltrated Graf Granat's Domain along with Lügner and Linie under the guise of serving as an envoy of peace from Aura. 

## Personality]

Draht is extremely confident in his magic, going as far as to challenge Frieren on his own. He is reckless and inexperienced, choosing to target Frieren immediately instead of contributing to Lügner's deception. His sensory abilities are not as strong as Linie nor Lügner's, as he was unable to perceive the threat Frieren posed. 

## Appearance]

Draht is a young demon with dull green hair, purple eyes, and horns that are short and curve outwards. He wears a white button down shirt and dress pants with black tuxedo suspenders. His shirt has ruffles down the center and a collar tied with a striped bow at his throat. His shirt's sleeves are loose and taper off into a long cuff. 

## Synopsis]

### Aura the Guillotine Arc]

In Graf Granat's Domain, Linie and Draht, operating as peace envoys under Lügner, are sent to Graf Granat's heavily fortified city that is protected by a magical barrier cast by the Great Mage Flamme, keeping demons and monsters out of town. The barrier has made the city impenetrable in its ongoing conflict with a Sage of Destruction, Aura the Guillotine. The demons' mission is to negotiate or coerce Graf Granat into lowering the defensive barrier. However, Graf Granat reveals that he has no intentions of holding negotiations with the demons and he and his guards raise their swords against Lügner. In response, Draht readies himself for a fight, but Lügner intervenes, defusing the situation by falsely claiming his nonexistent father's death in response to the Graf grieving his own son.

Later, when Graf Granat leaves to think over Lügner's words, Draht goes to kill Frieren, who has been locked up after attempting to attack the demons when she first entered the town. He kills a guard with his magical wire and enters Frieren's cell, telling her that he is there to kill her. Although Frieren warns Draht that she is stronger than Aura, he responds that he does not believe her and summons a wire around Frieren's neck with the intent to decapitate her. However, Frieren coats her neck in mana, which prevents her own decapitation.

Despite this, Draht still acts self-assured of his victory and declares that he can cut through both her mana and neck. Frieren calls him out for his naivety before swiftly cutting his arm off with a blast of concentrated mana casted without her staff. Draht tries to attack her with his other arm, but Frieren cuts it off as well. In his last moments, he attempts to beg for his life, but Frieren blasts his neck with mana and kills him mid-sentence.

Later, Linie notes to Lügner that she can no longer detect Draht. Graf confronts them after finding the guard outside Frieren's cell dead and expresses that Frieren knew not to commit such a crime. He points out that Draht is missing and prepares to confront the demons. Lügner belittles Draht for acting on his own and ruining their mission, and he subsequently attacks the Graf and his guards with his magic.

## Abilities]

As one of Aura's subordinates Draht is a fairly skilled mage. However, he is easily defeated by Frieren, who comments that he lacks a proper battle experience.

### Spells]

- **Spell that creates a sharp wire** ｢魔 (ま) 力 (りょく) の糸 (いと) , *Maryoku no ito*?｣: Draht is able to summon wires made of mana which he can use to swiftly decapitate his enemies. The wires are summoned from his fingertips, and he can summon multiple wires at once. Draht claims that his wires are amongst the strongest of demonkind's spells.

## [CHARACTERS] Dünste
IntroductionGallery

**Dünste** ｢ドゥンスト, *Dunsuto*?｣ is a mage who participates in the First-Class Mage Exam. In the first stage of the exam, he is placed in the seventeenth party alongside Edel and Blei.

## Personality]

Not much is known about Dünste's personality. He is a quiet individual, choosing rarely to speak and often deferring to others, such as when he listened to Edel's orders to use fire on the frozen lake during the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam. When he and Blei are running from Sense's Spiegel clone, a wounded Blei stays back to hold it off and tells Dünste to flee. Despite his normally deferential attitude, Dünste briefly interjects and hesitates for a moment before running off to find others. 

## Appearance]

Dünste is a tall, thin mage with a recessed hairline and long hair that extends past his shoulders. He also sports a neatly groomed mustache. Dünste wears long, black robes with two accented jacket panels and a light colored hood. He wears a white turtleneck shirt beneath the robes. 

## Synopsis]

##### First-Class Mage Exam Arc (First Stage)]

Dünste is one of the participants in the First-Class Mage Exam held in Äußerst. In the first stage of the exam, he is placed in the seventeenth party alongside Edel and Blei. The party has the idea to wait by the lake for a Stille to appear. When Lawine freezes the lake, the seventeenth party appears shocked. Dünste and Blei are ordered by Edel to try to melt the lake with fire magic. It is unknown what happens after this but towards the end of the exam, Dünste is shown to have fallen over. There is a Stille perched on him and Edel and Blei sneak up on it to catch it. He and the rest of the seventeenth party thus manage to pass the first stage of the exam.

In the interim between the first and second stage he is shown walking around Äußerst with Edel and Blei. He reads the notice about the second exam together with them.

###### First-Class Mage Exam Arc (Second Stage)]

Dünste is among the participants who listen to Sense explain the second stage of the exam. After some time deliberating, Dünste, Edel and Blei all head inside together. They make progress into the dungeon, but they are ultimately cornered by Sense's Spiegel clone. Dünste listens to Edel explain the properties of modern magic and why he and Blei would have trouble fighting in a dungeon. After, Blei asks Edel if her magic could work on the clone. Edel is unsure, but Blei convinces her to give it a shot. Dünste asks how long they would need to hold off the clone, and soon after Sense's Spiegel clone attacks, causing them to fall to her level from a higher point in the dungeon. The three of them attack Sense's clone by using the spell to make things float and throwing large chunks of debris at the clone. At Edel's command, Dünste and Blei use defensive magic to try to hold off the clone's hair attacks. However, they are not able to hold off the clone for very long, as it incorporates both of defensive magic's weaknesses in its attack. After Edel's gambit fails and she is wounded, Dünste casts offensive magic to protect Edel. Edel tells them to find fighters to help them before she uses her golem to escape. As they run away they are chased by the Spiegel clone which mortally wounds Blei. Dünste tries to stay back for a moment to help, but Blei tells him to run, as he can try to hold off Sense's clone and at the very least one of them should pass. Dünste hesitates for a moment before escaping.

Dünste later comes across the main group at the bottom of the dungeon. He falls to the ground, having been wounded on the shoulder by Sense's clone while fleeing. Methode quickly comes to his aid, and when she asks after Edel's whereabouts Dünste explains the story to the group. He then tells the group that he has information and asks if they would be willing to work together, which Denken points out is what he had wanted from the beginning. Dünste is healed by Methode's healing magic while he joins the strategy meeting. He affirms to the rest that the Spiegel clones don't have minds so hypnosis magic does not work on them. He then listens to Lawine and Kanne's information about the clones. As the others formulate a plan, Fern brings up that the clones probably have the same vulnerabilities as the person they copied, which Dünste agrees with. Fern then demonstrates Frieren's weakness to the group, which much to everyone's shock is an amateur mistake. After this, they all work together to find a way to beat the clones. As Frieren and Fern enter the innermost room of the dungeon to fight the clone, Denken asks everyone which mage they'd have the worst matchup against. The rest of the group has been tasked with stopping the other clones from gathering at the base of the dungeon, which could attack a distracted Frieren and Fern and cause everyone to be defeated.

As Dünste and Kanne both are unable to utilize their magic effectively within a dungeon, they are tasked to team up against the clone of Richter together. Dünste attacks the Richter clone with offensive magic which he dodges. As the clone uses Bargland to disrupt the ground, Dünste blocks with defensive magic. Kanne then tries to sneak attack the clone, and when that fails, both Dünste and Kanne attack together. They continue the battle of attrition while Frieren and Fern fight the Spiegel clone of Frieren. Towards the end of the fight, Richter's clone uses Bargland once again, but before the attack can land and do damage, the clone disappears, showing Frieren and Fern were victorious in their fight. Dünste then joins the crowd of people at the bottom of the dungeon in the treasury room, where they witness Frieren stuck in a mimic. He and the others are then congratulated by Sense and told that they have passed the second stage of the First-Class Mage Exam.

###### First-Class Mage Exam (Third Stage)]

Dünste is later seen amongst the rest of the examinees listening to Falsch explain the structure of the third stage of the exam. He is the second examinee to speak to Serie. Serie fails him right away, presumably for being scared of how much mana she has or for being unable to visualize becoming a first-class mage. It is unknown what Dünste does after the First-Class Mage Exam concludes.

## Abilities]

Not much is known about Dünste's abilities, though in order to participate in the First-Class Mage Exam, his rank is at least fifth-class. According to Edel, his magic cannot be used within the Ruins of the King's Tomb. It is likely that he uses a modern magic that manipulates matter that isn't found subterraneously or within man-made structures.

### Spells]

- **Unnamed Fire Spell** ｢炎 (ほのお) の魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Honō no mahō*?｣: In the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, Dünste casts a fire spell in order to try to melt the lake that Lawine has frozen over.

- **Offensive magic: Zoltraak** ｢一般攻撃魔法 (ゾルトラーク) , *Zorutorāku*?｣: A basic offensive spell that fires a blast of concentrated mana. In the second stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, Dünste used this spell against Sense's Spiegel Clone, as well as Richter's Clone.

- **Defensive magic** ｢防 (ぼう) 御 (ぎょ) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Bōgyo mahō*?｣: The standard defensive spell commonly employed by modern mages. Dünste casts it alongside Blei to shield themselves and Edel within a protective sphere against Sense’s Spiegel Clone.

- **Mana-driven telekinesis:** During the battle against Sense's Spiegel clone, Dünste is shown lifting and hurling slabs of rock using his staff.

## Trivia]

- Dünste's name is likely based on the German word "Dunst," which means "vapor" or "haze." "Dünste" is the plural form of "Dunst."

- In Chapter 52, Dünste is referred to as "Dünnste" by Methode. This was likely an error.

- Dünste ranked the following in the official popularity polls:
74th in the first popularity contest.

- 79th in the second popularity contest, where multiple votes per character were counted.
In this same contest, Dünste ranked 83rd when counting only unique votes (one vote per character per person).

## [CHARACTERS] Edel
IntroductionGallery

**Edel** ｢エーデル, *Ēderu*?｣ is a second-class human mage participating in the First-Class Mage Exam. She is placed in the seventeenth party, alongside Blei and Dünste, during the first stage of the exam. She specializes in hypnosis magic.

## Personality]

Edel is a remarkably level-headed mage while under pressure, as shown by her calm behavior while she is up against Sense's Spiegel clone in the First-Class Mage Exam and Macht on the expedition to the Golden Land. Despite Macht's renown, she succeeds in reading Macht's memories. Lernen calls her a braver mage than he is. 

Otherwise, Edel appears slightly apathetic, stating her unwillingness to work after Lernen approaches her with a personal request. She is also highly domineering, constantly yelling at Blei and Dünste during the first stage of the exam. 

## Appearance]

Edel has the physique of a petite teenage girl and short, strawberry-blonde hair that is styled into a bob cut with curtain bangs. She has droopy, hazel eyes.

Throughout the First-Class Mage Exam, Edel wears a white, button-up dress with short puff sleeves and long, black boots. During her investigation of Weise with Lernen, she dons a cape-like coat and long pants.

## Synopsis]

### First-Class Mage Exam (First Stage)]

Edel is a second-class mage that is placed in the seventeenth party during the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, alongside Blei and Dünste. Not much is known about the activities of the seventeenth party during the first stage, however, after being paired with Blei and Dünste, Edel appears to take on the leadership role in their party. They decide to wait around the lake for Stille to gather. However, once the second party freezes the lake, she does not have the acumen to realize that Stilles will no longer approach the lake and orders her teammates to use fire magic to melt the ice instead. 

She and her teammates are able to secure a Stille in the final few hours of the exam once a Stille lands on Dünste's back while he is hunched over.

### First-Class Mage Exam (Second Stage)]

At the beginning of the second stage exam held at the Ruins of the King's Tomb, Edel enters almost immediately with her first stage partners, Blei and Dünste, rather than partnering up with the other mages. 

While the examinees are strategizing over how to defeat Frieren's clone created by the Spiegel, Edel is brought up as a possible counter to Frieren's clone. Methode suggests that Edel may be able to bypass the clone's mental defenses, if it has a mind.

While Edel and her first stage teammates are inside the dungeon, they encounter Sense's clone created by the Spiegel. Knowing they will not be able to hide for long, Blei asks Edel if her hypnosis magic would be able to work on the clone. Edel orders Blei and Dünste to cast a full sphere of defensive magic in order to give her time to make eye contact and speak to the clone to try and create an opening. However, this fails, leaving her vulnerable to a serious injury from Sense's clone, and Edel concludes that the clone does not have a mind. Heavily wounded, Edel resigns and uses her golem bottle to escape, failing the exam. 

After the second stage of the exam concludes, Edel is seen outside the dungeon with the other examinees who failed. As one of Lernen's golems heal Richter, she marvels at the golems' ability to use healing magic.

### The Golden Land Arc]

Edel is recruited by Lernen to assist him on the expedition to scout out the Fortified City of Weise, which has been transmuted into gold. Lernen explains that he wishes to gather information about Weise and aid his friend Denken, whose hometown is Weise. Lernen tasks her with restoring the functionality of the Stone Bracelet of Servitude, which he believes is defective, as the demon Macht transmuted Weise and its residents—including his master, Weise's feudal lord Glück—into gold, despite wearing the bracelet. He shows her a replica of the bracelet at the Continental Magic Association's northern branch building in Äußerst. Lernen explains that although the replica does not hold the same power, its magical structure has been faithfully reproduced.

After Edel examines the replica, she goes with Lernen to Weise. Upon arriving, Edel reads the memory of a former citizen of Weise, a servant of Glück's family, who witnessed the ceremony where Macht was equipped with the Stone Bracelet of Servitude. She notes that the command given was not precise enough for a demon to be adequately bound by. Edel also recognizes that the belief that Glück commanded Macht in order to gain wealth is logically unsound, since Macht's gold cannot be refined, which is one of the major properties of gold that gives it value.

Before reaching the barrier of the Golden Land, they encounter second-class mage Früh, who was part of the advance party sent to scout the Golden Land. She tells them that the advance party was wiped out in a flash. Lernen asks why Früh was the only one allowed to escape; as he speaks, she begins to turn to gold. He tells Edel to read her memories to no avail, as she turns into gold before either of them can move. After crossing the barrier into the Golden Land, Edel and Lernen are discovered by Macht almost immediately, and a battle between Macht and Lernen ensues. Edel works on restoring the Stone Bracelet of Servitude, but she realizes that no defect exists. Edel also confirms that no additional command can be placed on the bracelet except by the one who gave the original command.

While Macht is attacking Lernen, Edel sneaks up behind Macht and touches him, reading a hundred years' worth of memories at the cost of most of her strength. The two then manage to escape from Macht, with Edel visibly worn out on the carriage ride back to Äußerst. On the carriage ride back, Edel asks Lernen why he is going so far to help Denken. Lernen tells Edel about his and Denken's shared history, and how now that they are old and the end can come at anytime, he wishes to assist Denken in seeing the colors of his hometown again. Seeing Edel's expression, Lernen asks her whether she thinks Denken made up his mind too late. Edel answers truthfully that Denken was way too late in making his decision, and Lernen agrees with her, but also says that he understands. As humans, their time is limited, and there is no such thing as "someday" in their lives.

## Relationships]

### Lernen]

Edel was personally handpicked by Lernen to restore the functionality of the Stone Bracelet of Servitude. The two are familiar with each other, with Edel having been called upon for jobs by the Continental Magic Association before, presumably for her exceptional mental magic. Lernen thinks very highly of Edel's abilities and her bravery, going as far as to praise her courage in front of Macht himself and calling her a much braver mage than himself. Edel is fairly restrained and respectful around Lernen. After hearing Denken's story from him, she initially refrains from sharing her thoughts, but Lernen is able to read that Edel thinks Denken made his decision much too late, which prompts her to speak her thoughts openly.

## Abilities]

Edel specializes in hypnosis magic, which comprises her family's business. She is also experienced with magic and spells related to memories, and she is capable of reading the memories of individuals with whom she makes physical contact with. However, her combat ability is practically nonexistent. Unlike most mages, Edel does not use a staff when casting spells, instead relying on her mental magic or other means of casting.

- **Keen Intellect:** Edel is shown to be a highly analytical person, as shown when she swiftly analyzes the exact mechanics of Sense's magic when confronting her Spiegel clone and begins devising a strategy to defeat it. She is also able to quickly coordinate her teammates to counter the clone, resulting in them successfully putting up a defense against it.

### Spells]

- **Hypnosis magic** ｢精 (せい) 神 (しん) 操 (そう) 作 (さ) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Seishin sōsa mahō*?｣: Edel's expertise is in hypnosis magic, and she can forcefully manipulate the actions of those she has within her sight by giving verbal commands. However, this magic does not work on those without minds, such as the clones created by the Spiegel. First-class mage Lernen considers Edel to be an expert at hynopsis magic, with her knowledge in the field surpassing even the current first-class mages.

- **Mana-driven telekinesis:** During her team's battle against Sense's Spiegel clone, Edel is able to levitate the debris consisting of large boulders and huge slabs of rock. Edel can then hurl these projectiles by clapping both of her hands together in the direction of the target.

- **Memory transference spell** ｢記 (き) 憶 (おく) の譲 (じょう) 渡 (と) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Kioku no jōto mahō*?｣: Edel can read humans' memories, as shown when Edel reads the memory of the former servant of Glück's family, who witnessed the transference of the Stone Bracelet of Servitude. She can also read the memories of demons, a feat that is extremely difficult and painful due to the differences between humans' and demons' minds. Frieren also notes that Edel is an "incredible hypnosis-magic user" for reading Macht's memories, and Frieren again praises Edel after being told by Denken that Edel had obtained a hundred years worth of memories with a single touch. Edel is also able to transfer memories from herself to another or vice versa.

- **Magic restoration**: For items embedded with hypnosis magic, Edel is capable of analyzing and restoring them if they are malfunctioning. She exhibits this ability with the Stone Bracelet of Servitude placed on Macht, which she is able to analyze even from a distance.

## [CHARACTERS] Ehre
IntroductionGallery

**Ehre** ｢エーレ, *Ēre*?｣ is a second-class mage that participates in the First-Class Mage Exam. In the first exam, she is placed in the eighth party alongside Wirbel and Scharf. Fern considers her to be the strongest within both the fourth and eighth parties.

## Personality]

Ehre maintains a cool and collected façade. She remains relatively emotionless and speaks in an even cadence. In fights, she is analytical of her opponents and calmly attacks and dodges. However, once she is met with an attack she isn't expecting, her façade quickly cracks. She is easily overwhelmed by surprises that she doesn't readily know how to handle. When low on mana, Ehre shows a much more petulant and childish side, getting angry when Wirbel attempts to float her and demanding a piggy-back ride from him. Despite her outward appearance, she is friendly towards her party, hanging out with them even outside of the exam. She readily extends offers of kindness, such as when she offered to introduce her grandfather to Wirbel when he complains about having to take the sea-route back north if he fails the First-Class Mage Exam.

## Appearance]

Ehre has wavy, shoulder-length brown hair and dark brown eyes. She wears a long white tunic belted at the waist, a long, dark green skirt, and black boots. Her tunic is long sleeved, covers the neck, and has simple green lining on the sleeves. It is pleated down the middle in the front. Atop the tunic and skirt, Ehre wears a purple cape clasped with a green jewel at the front. 

When she was younger, Ehre's hair fell to middle back. She wore a pink shirt and a white skirt tied at the back with a bow.

When fighting, Ehre uses a metallic staff. Her staff is long, with a single large ring suspended at the top, and thin discs around the handle of the staff at the base and top. 

## Synopsis]

### History]

When Ehre was younger, her village in the north was attacked by demons. Wirbel was one of the humans who defeated the demons attacking her village.

### First-Class Mage Exam (First Stage)]

Ehre is one of the participants of the First-Class Mage Exam in Äußerst. During the first stage of the exam, she is placed in the eighth party with Wirbel and Scharf. Their party has no luck finding a Stille, so they decide to ambush a party that has already captured a Stille and steal it. After Wirbel's surprise attack against the fourth party is blocked, she rushes in along with the rest of her party and faces off against Fern. After Land calls for the fourth party to scatter, Ehre faces Fern alone.

During their battle, she stays above Fern with flight magic and uses Doragate to try to break Fern's defensive spells. While fighting Fern, Ehre begins to feel uneasy, as Fern fights like a seasoned mage and reminds her of fighting against her grandfather. She asks if Fern is trying to not show her hand by only using basic offensive and defensive spells, and she tells Fern that she would not last long in a fight against Wirbel. However, Fern believes Ehre to be the strongest mage of both their parties. Ehre hesitates before replying that Wirbel, who is the captain of the Northern Magic Corps, has much more experience in fighting. His magic is vulgar and cowardly, but it is extremely effective, and Ehre believes that the girl fighting Wirbel is likely to be killed. However, this taunt does not affect Fern, who immediately strikes at Ehre with a saturation attack. Ehre is unable to withstand the barrage of Zoltraak spells, and she is forced to use an omnidirectional defensive barrier. As Fern's attack continues, Ehre becomes visibly rattled as she draws her defensive barriers closer to herself. She exclaims that she cannot handle so many spells, before buckling under the force of a a large explosion of mana. 

After defeating Ehre, Fern interrupts Wirbel's battle with Übel and tells Wirbel that she has killed Ehre; hearing this, Wirbel decides to spare Übel, as their party has already been disqualified.

When Wirbel goes to retrieve Ehre's body, he finds that Fern has not killed Ehre at all, and instead, Ehre has merely been knocked out. Annoyed at the lie, he tells Ehre to wake up, and he calls Ehre lame for running out of mana since she was the top student at the Academy of Magic. Ehre explains that she was overwhelmed by the sheer force of ordinary offensive spells, though she expects Wirbel to not believe her. However, seeing the path of destruction that Fern's attack has left, Wirbel responds that he does. He tells Ehre that he does not understand why she fought Fern head-on like an idiot, as it was a battle she could have won. Wirbel tells her that they were to regroup with Scharf, but Ehre tells him that she cannot walk. Wirbel smiles, calling her a pain, before he floats her with a spell; Ehre then exclaims at him to not treat her like an object and demands a piggy-back ride. This elicits genuine annoyance from Wirbel, but he acquiesces nonetheless and carries her on his back while they find Scharf. 

When they discover that Scharf, too, has run out of mana and cannot walk on his own, Wirbel bemoans that their failure in the exam is absolute. Ehre hears a sound and wonders what it is; Wirbel replies that it is probably raining outside the barrier, which is fitting for his mental state. He lays out the facts of their situation: it is two or three hours before sunset, and they have two party members that can no longer fight, making the odds of them being able to steal a Stille low. Ehre points out that despite this, Wirbel has chosen to help her and Scharf, to which Wirbel retorts that he could ditch them.

Ehre continues, asking whether kindness was the reason why Wirbel fought demons and reminds him that when she was younger, he had saved her village from a demon attack. Wirbel calls this notion ridiculous, as he believes people do not risk their lives out of kindness. For him, the motivation to fight demons came from a girl in his hometown he had a crush on, who fled his hometown to the Central Lands because of the increase in demon activity in the north. Wanting to look cool, he promised his crush he would kill all the demons in the north so she could return. However, as this happened when he was four or five years old, he no longer even remembers her face or her name. Hearing this, Ehre smiles and calls him a fool. Wirbel then bemoans that he must go home by boat again, as he gets horrible seasickness. Ehre offers to introduce him to her grandfather, a first-class mage, who could take him by land. She cuts herself off as, in that moment, she spots a Stille. Wirbel catches it with Sorganeil, and he wonders what the point of all their effort was. 

Before the first exam ends, the eighth party are seen still walking around with Ehre on Wirbel's back and Scharf getting levitated. They are one of the six parties to pass the first stage of the exam. 

It is unknown what Ehre does during the time between the first and second stage of the exam in Äußerst. She is seen meditating alone in a forest when the messenger birds deliver news of Sense's second exam. 

### First-Class Mage Exam (Second Stage)]

During the second stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, Ehre enters the Ruins of the King's Tomb with Wirbel and Scharf. They walk along a twisting series of pillars when Ehre is restrained by Sorganeil. She warns the rest of the party that they are being ambushed by three mages that have concealed their mana. Wirbel throws up a shield and blocks an attack meant for the party. He explains to them how Sorganeil works— the user must have their target in full vision—and tells Scharf to block their sight using his flower petals. From behind the barrier, they watch as the Spiegel clone versions of their party approach them. Wirbel assigns roles to the team, and he tells Ehre to take care of the clone Wirbel. 

After defeating the clones, they are found by Methode, who conveys to them the plan that the examinees gathered at the depths of the dungeon have decided upon. Methode asks for their assistance in defeating Denken, who she expects to be one of the more troublesome clones. Methode explains that she will fight the clone of Fern on her own. Ehre warns Methode that Fern is strong, and asks if she will be okay alone, but Methode assures her she will be fine. Ehre fights Denken alongside Scharf and Wirbel for the rest of the exam. After the Spiegel's defeat by Frieren and Fern, she is shown sitting on the floor complaining that she can't move. Wirbel gives her a piggy-back ride to the treasury room in the depths of the dungeon, where Sense announces that all the gathered participants have passed the second stage of the First-Class Mage Exam.

### First-Class Mage Exam (Final Stage)]

Ehre gathers with the rest of the examinees that passed the second stage of the exam in front of the doors of the Northern Continental Magic Association in Äußerst. Falsch informs them that the exam will be an interview with Serie. Ehre is the fifth mage that Serie interviews. She is summarily failed for not possessing what Serie determines to be the qualities of a first-class mage. After the third stage, she is shown standing outside the doors of the Continental Magic Association while Wirbel comforts Scharf.

After the privilege conferment ceremony, Ehre and Scharf convince Wirbel to go back to the north with them. They watch from the side while Wirbel talks to Frieren about the Hero Himmel. The day after the privilege conferment ceremony, Ehre introduces Wirbel and Scharf to her grandfather, Lernen. The three then leave Äußerst together.

### Continued Northern Travels]

Shortly after the First-Class Mage Exam, Wirbel, Ehre, and Scharf rest at an inn at the fork in the road in the Great Sanft Forest. The road forks off to the Northern Plateau and the Neutral Harbor. They have drinks and a meal in the inn when Frieren's Party walks in, and Wirbel goes to greet them. He explains that because demonic activity in the north has suddenly increased, they will be traveling by sea again, and he will be with Ehre and Scharf until they reach the port town in the Imperial Capital. Ehre joins their conversation and adds that Wirbel has been whining about not wanting to get seasickness. Wirbel then asks Frieren to let him convince Stark to join him in the Northern Frontier. Ehre spends the rest of the time with Wirbel, Scharf, and Stark. According to Frieren, they look to be having a good time. The next day, they bid Frieren's Party goodbye, and Ehre departs towards the Neutral Harbor with Wirbel and Scharf.

## Relationships]

### Wirbel]

Wirbel and Ehre have a friendly relationship. They both possess knowledge about each others' feats and appear to respect each other as mages. Ehre describes Wirbel's magic as having no character and is under no qualms about his attitude about killing. Wirbel, meanwhile, has higher expectations of Ehre due to her position as a top graduate from the Academy of Magic. Though she loses against Fern, Wirbel still thinks highly of her abilities, and he tells her that it was a match that she could have won had she not fought Fern head on.

Ehre shows a much more childish side around Wirbel, and although Wirbel expresses his annoyance at her requests, he acquiesces to them anyway. Wirbel fought against the demons attacking her village and saved the village when she was a child. On Ehre's part, she expresses curiosity at his motivation for fighting demons like the ones that invaded her village, and though she calls his reason foolish, her remark is good-natured and Wirbel doesn't take offense. Upon hearing about his seasickness, Ehre offers to introduce Wirbel to her grandfather, a first-class mage, should they fail the exam. During the second stage of the exam, Ehre enters the Ruins of the King's Tomb with Wirbel and Scharf. After the First-Class Mage Exam, Scharf and Ehre convince Wirbel to travel to the harbor with them, showing that they have become fairly familiar with one another.

### Lernen]

Lernen is Ehre's first-class mage grandfather that she mentioned during the first stage of the exam. She introduces him to Wirbel and Scharf after the First-Class Mage Exam. Presumably, they have a good relationship, as Lernen is willing to take time out of his duties in Äußerst to meet Ehre, and Ehre is confident that she can introduce Wirbel to Lernen should he need a way to travel by land through the Northern Plateau.

## Abilities]

Ehre is a second-class mage who graduated top of her class from the Academy of Magic.

- **High mana output:** Ehre is noted to have a high mana capacity relative to her peers on several occasions. She was immediately assumed to be the most powerful amongst the fourth and eighth parties by Fern and able to easily overwhelm Wirbel and Scharf's mana by the former's own assessment. She is often seen employing flight throughout the First-Class Mage Exam, a spell mages usually use sparingly to conserve mana.

### Spells]

- **Change rocks into bullets: Doragate** ｢石を弾丸に変える魔法 (ドラガーテ) , *Doragāte*?｣: A form of offense magic that Ehre uses, where she floats in the air using flight magic and levitates several small rocks around her. She then shoots these rocks towards her enemy as a projectile. Fern describes the attack as being like a cannon.

- **Flight magic**: Allows the caster to levitate and maneuver through the air. Ehre was shown using it to attack her opponent from above.

- **Defensive magic** ｢防 (ぼう) 御 (ぎょ) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Bōgyo mahō*?｣: Ehre demonstrates competency at basic defensive magic. However, when Fern attacks her with a swarm of offensive magic, she is unable to withstand the onslaught.

## [CHARACTERS] Eisen
IntroductionSynopsisRelationshipsGallery

“
I'll teach you the secret to winning against a strong opponent. It's simple. Keep getting back up over and over and use your moves to strike them. The last warrior standing wins.—Eisen, in Chapter 20

**Eisen** ｢アイゼン, *Aizen*?｣ is a dwarf and the former warrior of the Hero Party that defeated the Demon King, consisting of himself alongside Frieren, Himmel, and Heiter. As a dwarf, he has a much longer lifespan than most humans, but a shorter one than elves.

## Personality]

Eisen is a witty and troublesome person, and failing to show respect to the king prior to their adventure almost had him and Himmel executed. Eisen is also known to be rather careless and tough, jumping down from extreme heights without a scratch.

He initially did not believe in religion, and thought of the deaths of his family in a matter-of-fact manner, shown by having them in a mass grave with a simple stone. However, after listening to Heiter say that he wants to believe they are in Heaven because it would be more comforting to the deceased, Eisen adopted the practice of praying at their graves. He has maintained this practice even in his old age.

## Appearance]

As a male dwarf, Eisen is of short stature and has a strong and bulky build. His brown hair and beard are of similar length and reach past his chest, and most of his face is obstructed by his beard.

Eisen wears a floor-length red cape with shoulder armor and a brown tunic underneath that is strapped by a belt around his waist. The cape obscures his arms bands, thigh trousers, and leather boots. Additionally, he wears a two-horned helmet with a nose guard. During battle, Eisen wields a large, double-bit axe.

In old age, Eisen has a notably thinner build, losing the majority of the muscle mass in his arms.

## Abilities]

As the frontliner of the Hero Party, Eisen possesses exceptional talents in combat. He is considered to be humanity's strongest warrior by several skilled fighters, including the strongest demon warrior Rivale and a famed hero Rasen. Linie who copied multitude of fighting styles also called him the strongest warrior she has ever encountered.

- **Superhuman durability**: Frieren claims that Eisen could have landed a freefall from any height without a scratch.

- **Superhuman strength**: His centuries of training have given Eisen exceptional physical abilities to the point where he claims he can break a diamond with his hands. He was also shown lifting a large boulder.

- **Superhuman speed**: Eisen can sprint fast enough to run on water without falling.

- **Superhuman reflexes**: When the Hero Party was attacked by Rivale, Eisen was the fastest to react, blocking his punch.

- **Poison resistance**: Eisen possesses abnormal resistance to poisons. He was able to endure geting hit by arrows coated with poison strong enough to knock out a dragon - a feat which scared even Heiter.

- **Axe proficiency**: Eisen is skilled enough with his weapon to exchange blows with powerful demon general Rivale and even leave a wound on his face.

### Techniques]

- **Lightning Strike** ｢閃 (せん) 天 (てん) 撃 (げき) , *Sentengeki*?｣: Wielding his signature double-bit battle axe, Eisen executes a powerful downward slash against his opponent. He brings his axe down with incredible speed and immense force, generating a shockwave that shatters the ground.

IntroductionGallery

**This article is currently under active development.**

*This article is expected to be high-traffic among editors, which can result in frequent changes. This may be due to its relevance in ongoing arcs or editors focusing on developing certain pages.*
*Feel free to help Frieren Wiki by **expanding it**. Please be sure to adhere to the Editor's Guidelines, Manual of Style, and Image Policy.*

The **Emperor** ｢皇 (こう) 帝 (てい) , *Kōtei*?｣ is a human mage and the ruler of the Empire - the largest magic-using civilization on the continent.

## Personality]

The Emperor is a calm individual and consistently formal in speech. He often reflects on impermanence, that nothing lasts forever, even his empire that has endured for over a thousand years. Even so, he works to preserve the Empire's continuity and prosperity and, if it falls, to ensure a peaceful end.

He can be self-deprecating, calling himself a fool and stressing that the Empire’s institutions are built to endure regardless of whether he sits on the throne. At the same time, he is perceptive and quick to catch political maneuvering, such as Fräse quietly sidelining Denken before the ball. He calls himself conscientious and tries to repay those who have protected the Empire, notably Denken and Fräse.

According to Serie, he is a careful and shrewd rationalist who understands the importance of appearances and protocol. She also calls him a real swindler.

## Appearance]

The Emperor is a tall, slender young man with shoulder-length, light-colored hair that is softly wavy and parted. He has half-lidded eyes and no facial hair. 

He wears a long, dark, high-collared dress uniform with two vertical rows of metal buttons, a diagonal sash across the chest, and a belt at the waist. The sleeves feature a wide light band with a small buttoned strap and end in a small ruffled cuff at the wrist. He also wears dark trousers and shoes, as well as a shoulder-attached cape that falls to about his ankles. The shoulders have fringed epaulettes worn over the cape’s attachment.

At times, the Emperor wears a rounded ceremonial crown with a jeweled band at the base and several arches that meet at the top. The arches rise from the circlet and curve inward, dipping slightly before joining a small orb at the center. Between the arches are dark fabric sections with lighter, diamond-patterned strips showing underneath. Above the orb sits a diamond-shaped ornament.

## Synopsis]

### History]

At some point more than fifteen years after the passing of Himmel the Hero, the current Emperor ascended to the throne of the Empire. 

### Foundation Festival Arc]

Around thirty-one years after the passing of Himmel the Hero, the Emperor extends an invitation to the Great Mage Serie, representing the Continental Magic Association, to attend the imperial palace ball during the National Foundation Festival. Under his arrangement with Denken, he plans to meet her there to lay the groundwork for an amicable treaty between the Empire and the Association.

On the night before the Foundation Festival ball, the Emperor encounters Serie in the palace and, using a dream-lantern, quickly realizes he is inside her prophetic dream. He explains to her that this “Emperor” is a conscious projection protected by the Empire’s mental-defense magic, allowing him to choose what can be disclosed. To prevent both imperial decline and the assassination plot against Serie at the ball, he proposes an exchange of information, which Serie agrees to. The Emperor notes that his authority cannot directly stop the assassination, while Serie outlines her situation, the limits of her dream spell, and her suspicion that another clairvoyant is involved. When asked for suspects, he names Fräse as the only person who comes to mind, though both doubt she wields such a spell. They then turn to their shared endgame. With the situation now clear, the Emperor asks what information Serie seeks from him.

After the start of the ball, the Emperor asks Fräse, captain of the Magic Special Forces, for a status report. She answers that everything is proceeding smoothly and adds that Serie has requested an audience. When the Emperor notes that Serie has brought a large entourage, Fräse recommends a show of authority and offers an escort from her unit. He agrees and tells her to proceed at a measured pace so it looks more stately. He then circles back to what she is leaving out, pointing out that she deliberately sidelined Denken. Fräse admits she acted on her own and asks that her execution be delayed until the affair is over. But the Emperor brushes this aside, saying he would have sent her to the gallows long ago had he known a way to kill her. Even so, he acknowledges that Fräse and Denken, though opposites, have long kept the nation safe. He adds that he wishes to honor her as he did Denken, but Fräse declines and urges His Majesty to keep turning a blind eye for now.

Shortly afterward, the Emperor enters the ballroom with an escort.

## Abilities]

The Emperor's exact physical and magical abilities are unknown. However, as the leader of the largest country in the Northern Lands, he wields immense political reach, influence, and power.

### Spells]

- **Mental defense mechanism**: The Emperor's body is equipped with an automatic mental defense crafted from the quintessence of Imperial magic. It is described as the culmination of a thousand years of Imperial research. The Emperor identifies himself as the caster, though he does not fully understand its principles. Functionally, it filters external intrusions and controls what information can leave the Emperor's mind. In prophetic dreams, it manifests a conscious version of the Emperor who chooses what to share and what to withhold.

## [CHARACTERS] Ewig the Sage
**Ewig the Sage** ｢賢 (けん) 者 (じゃ) エーヴィヒ, *Kenja Ēvihi*?｣ was a human Sage from the Mythical Era and an exceptional mage who propelled forward humanity's knowledge of magic. He was the creator of the Stone Bracelet of Servitude.

## Personality]

Not much is known about Ewig's personality. However, his studies in magic hint at his curious mind and his endeavors towards the betterment of society, as he recorded the knowledge he gained in grimoires. His creation of the Stone Bracelet of Servitude is also a reflection of his inventiveness.

## Appearance]

Ewig the Sage was of a typical human stature. His hair was long, dark, and wavy, and it flowed down to his lower back. He wore a simple, long robe that reached the ground. He wore another garment layer underneath his robe, which was bound with a sash. Over his robe, Ewig wore a short, cloak-like cape with a fringe layer along the hem. As a mage, he wielded a straight staff with a curved top that had a gem in the center.

## Synopsis]

### History]

Ewig the Sage was a mage from the Mythical Era whose grimoires supposedly contained secrets about immortality and resurrection. He coded his grimoires with images. At some point, Ewig recorded his knowledge of the water-mirror demon, the Spiegel, into his adventuring tales.

### Beyond Journey's End Arc]

Twenty years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Frieren visits Heiter, where she gets presented a grimoire written by Ewig the Sage that was excavated from the sage's grave. Heiter explains that the grimoire is said to contain long-lost spells of resurrection and immortality. Frieren disbelieves this claim, but she is willing to decipher it for Heiter, and she estimates the task will take approximately five to six years as people from back then were fond of image ciphers. 

After a few years go by, Frieren finishes deciphering the grimoire and presents Heiter with the notes on his deathbed. With her findings, she reveals that no spells for resurrection and immortality were recorded in the book. Heiter tells the elf that if such a thing existed, Ewig himself would have used it, as fear of death is immeasurable. He reveals that the deciphering was an excuse to trick Frieren into training Fern so the young mage would not be a burden as an apprentice.

### First-Class Mage Exam Arc]

Twenty-nine years after the death of Himmel the Hero, during the second stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, proctors Genau and Falsch converse about proctor Sense's choice of the Ruins of the King's Tomb as a test location. Genau tells Falsch that the Spiegel, a water-mirror demon and the lord of the dungeon, is a monster from the mythical times and appears in Ewig's heroic tales.

### The Golden Land Arc]

Thirty years after the death of Himmel the Hero, first-class mage Lernen approaches the second-class mage Edel for aid on a mission. He explains that he is trying to help his friend Denken, and he requests for Edel to help him investigate the Stone Bracelet of Servitude—the only item in the world which can control the mind of a demon—because she is highly skilled in hypnosis magic. Lernen discloses that he believed the item malfunctioned, as the demon Macht, who had to wear the bracelet by the order of the people in the city of Weise, was ultimately able to curse the Golden Land. He shows Edel a faithfully recreated replica and asks her to analyze the hypnosis spell placed on it, as the original bracelet was reportedly still being worn by Macht. 

After confronting Macht and investigating the real bracelet firsthand, Edel verifies to Lernen that the Stone Bracelet of Servitude has always functioned correctly and the hypnosis magic had not lost its effect. She also reveals that only the original user can add another command to it.

## Abilities]

- **Hypnosis magic** ｢精 (せい) 神 (しん) 操 (そう) 作 (さ) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Seishin sōsa mahō*?｣: Ewig was capable of hypnosis magic, as he created the Stone Bracelet of Servitude, a bracelet with a hypnosis spell cast on it that allowed individuals to give a command to the wearer and force them to obey. Notably, this bracelet was the only magical item known to be able to manipulate a demon's mind. Despite being created so long ago, Edel confirms that the Stone Bracelet of Servitude placed on Macht of the Golden Land is still functioning properly.

## [CHARACTERS] Falsch
IntroductionGallery

**Falsch** ｢ファルシュ, *Farushu*?｣ is a first-class mage. He gauges the candidates with Sense for the First-Class Mage Exam on the sidelines before the first stage begins and is the one to announce the format of the third stage of the exam.

## Personality]

Falsch is an observant and perceptive first-class mage, demonstrated by his keen analysis of the exam candidates and their backgrounds. He is confident in his abilities and assessments, possessing a deep understanding of mana manipulation, even though he is not always correct, as shown when he fails to notice Frieren's mana suppression.

Falsch remains composed even in the face of setbacks, such as after the capture of Übel and Land by the Magic Special Forces. He prefers to wait and observe rather than rush into action, and serves as the voice of reason when Sense proposes reckless endeavors. His maturity is further evident in his exasperation at the hostilities between Lineal and Sense. He is also skilled domestically and rises early to cook and make sure his fellow first-class mage Sense is appropriately prepared for the day.

## Appearance]

Falsch is a human mage of tall stature. He has short, slicked back dark hair, with two long strands flowing loosely over his forehead. He wears round glasses, and like the other first-class mages his attire features the color dark blue prominently. Falsch wears a predominantly dark blue robe, with gray lining and an upturned collar, paired with a short cape that drapes over his shoulders.

## Synopsis]

At some point prior to Übel's attempt at the Second-Class Mage Exam, Falsch passes the First-Class Mage Exam and becomes a first-class mage. He becomes one of Serie's apprentices in Äußerst. 

Falsch is present along with fellow first-class mage Sense during the second stage of the Second-Class Mage Exam proctored by Burg. He reads a book throughout the second stage, and appears mildly surprised when Übel manages to kill Burg.

### First-Class Mage Exam Arc (First Stage)]

Before the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam begins, Falsch and Sense stand to the side in the exam hall and observe the pool of candidates. Falsch remarks that the quality of the candidates this year appears to be pretty good. In particular, he points out Wirbel, Captain of the Northern Magic Corps, Denken, the imperial mage, and Fern, the youngest mage to pass the third-class exam with the highest score. Falsch then pushes up his glasses and remarks that they have a troublemaker in their midst as well—Übel. Falsch continues to assess which candidates are promising, and his attention is drawn by Frieren, who he notes has the mana of an old, experienced mage. He asks Sense who that mage is but Sense also has no idea, and they are distracted by Genau announcing the start of the first stage of the exam.

### First-Class Mage Exam Arc (Second Stage)]

While Sense conducts the second stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, Falsch is seen having tea with Genau in a library of the Continental Magic Association. After Genau explains why the Ruins of the King's Tomb has thus far been impregnable, Falsch questions why Sense would choose the dungeon as the location of the second stage of the exam.

### First-Class Mage Exam Arc (Final Stage)]

Before the third stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, Serie arrives and gathers all the first-class mages in her room in the Continental Magic Association. Lernen tells Serie that he is unqualified to test Frieren, as he was able to tell at a glance that Frieren was suppressing her mana. Serie then asks Falsch whether he noticed this as well, to which Falsch replies negatively. Falsch states that he saw Frieren's mana in the exam hall with his own eyes, and that there was no sign of the instability that occurs whenever mana is restrained. He demonstrates this by restraining his own mana and showing the resultant instability. Falsch then concludes that even if it were possible, to eliminate this instability, one would have to spend an unimaginable amount of time working on mana restraint, rendering it an unpractical technique. Serie tells the other first-class mages that Frieren is one that has devoted her whole life to said unpractical technique.

Later, Falsch is the one to announce the format of the third stage to the remaining first-class mage candidates. He tells the mages that have gathered in front of the doors of the exam hall that the third stage will be an interview with the Great Mage Serie.

### Foundation Festival Arc]

During the National Foundation Festival, Falsch and Sense are assigned to protect Serie after First-Class Mage Lineal warns them of an assassination plot targeting her during the grand ball in the Imperial Capital, Eiseberg.

In the capital, Falsch and Sense await the arrival of Frieren's party and seek their assistance. As Sense outlines the mission, Fern asks about the other two First-Class Mages involved. Falsch explains that Übel and Land are currently gathering vital intelligence.

Later that day, after Übel and Land were captured by the Empire’s Magic Special Forces, Falsch and Sense discuss the situation and wonder what the Special Forces might be doing here in the capital. Eventually, Sense decides that she will bail out both Übel and Land, though Falsch advises against this, noting the Special Forces' resentment towards Sense and their familiarity with her. Falsch recommends that they should wait it out.

The next day, Falsch prepares breakfast for the group, including Fern, Stark, Frieren, and Sense. While pouring a drink for Sense, he chides her for reading during the meal. After breakfast, Frieren, Fern, and Stark go to the market and buy a vase from the era of the Unified Empire. Upon their return, Falsch examines the vase and confirms it is a fake, which causes Frieren to fall down and cry. Later, as Frieren sulks, Falsch is seen examining a map for the upcoming operation.

After the Shadow Warriors conclude their meeting, Falsch secretly watches Routine and Iris from behind a pillar as they leave through an underground passage.

*Feel free to help Frieren Wiki by **expanding it**. Please be sure to adhere to the Editor's Guidelines, Manual of Style, and Image Policy.*

## Abilities]

Falsch is a strong mage, as indicated by his status as a first-class mage. He is one of the three mages pictured, alongside Sense and Genau, when Richter extols the inhuman power of first-class mages.

- **Mana detection:** Falsch is shown to be skilled at mana detection. Before the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, he is able to clearly discern the mana output of the candidates and point out which candidates are most promising. However, unlike Lernen, Falsch is unable to detect the fluctuations of Frieren's restrained mana output.

- **Hand-to-hand combat:** As stated by Sense, both she and Falsch excel in hand-to-hand combat, and they are on the level of skilled Warriors. This suggests that Falsch's magic grants him powerful close-quarters capabilities similar to Sense's hair magic.

### Spells]

- **Unnamed shadow magic**: Falsch can conceal himself in a shadow and seemingly emerge at will. He also appears to be capable of manipulating the shadows around him.

- **Unnamed cloaking magic**: Falsch can cast a spell that envelops a target in a cloak, which he uses on Serie to keep her hidden.

- **Spell to change his voice freely**: After passing the First-Class Mage Exam, Falsch requested a voice changing spell from Serie. The spell allows Falsch to mimic the voice of any person he desires, and he specifically requested the spell to enable him to reproduce Serie's voice.

## [CHARACTERS] Fass
“
If you're gonna drink, you might as well enjoy it, eh?—Fass, in Chapter 69

IntroductionGallery

**Fass** ｢ファス, *Fasu*?｣ is a dwarf that lives in the Bier Region. He dedicated his life towards searching for the spirit named "Boshaft," having spent over two centuries looking for it.

## Personality]

Fass is very passionate about alcohol. He has eagerly dedicated two centuries of his life in search of an alcoholic drink and is willing to spend copious amounts of money and learn new skills in an effort to find the finest spirit. Fass is also good natured and positive. He gets along well with the townspeople and does not hesitate to share Boshaft once he finally finds it. Despite Frieren's fears that Fass would grow dispirited from learning his life's ambition had been for a spirit that was not actually good, Fass is cheerful upon finally trying Boshaft for himself and laughs about how awful it is. He immediately gathers all the townspeople to try the drink with him.

## Appearance]

Fass is, as all dwarves are, very small. He has darker hair that he wears a worn out top hat on top of and a bushy, disheveled beard. His attire consists of a white shirt tied at the waist with a thick black belt. The belt also holds his dark colored pants. He wears a baggy, oversized jacket on top of the rest of his attire.

## Synopsis]

### History]

Fass was born over two centuries ago in a town.

Eighty years ago, on their adventure to defeat the Demon King, the Hero Party met Fass. He asked them to help him with his goal to find the spirit "Boshaft," and although Heiter really wanted to assist, the Hero Party were forced to decline and move on with their quest. 

### Continued Northern Travels Arc]

Twenty-nine years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Frieren's Party visit the Bier Region and encounter Fass, who has progressed significantly in his quest for the spirit Boshaft. Fass tells them about the legend of Boshaft being buried in ruins in the area, which he came to strongly believe in when he found the stone monument carved by Milliarde. 

Fass explains to them that he learned how to mine in service of finding Boshaft, and leads them down the mine to the stone door at the end of the ruins. While he leads them, he explains that while dwarves are often associated with mines, he grew up in a town and thus he had to teach himself mining skills in order to dig the mine to reach Boshaft. He then asks Frieren to decipher the barrier barring access to the room behind the door, as Boshaft lies behind the door. When Frieren refuses, citing Fern and Stark's impatience, he offers to pay Frieren twenty Reich gold coins. When Frieren still declines, he then pleads with her, as it has been his dream to drink Boshaft and he has been searching for over two centuries. 

Once Frieren finally agrees, he spends the next three months assisting them where he can and spending time with Frieren, Fern, and Stark when they are not deciphering the barrier. After Frieren finally dispels the barrier, he remarks on how well Boshaft has been preserved, before taking a big swig of it. He appears at a loss for words, and Frieren interjects and calls the drink awful. When he sees Frieren, Fern, and Stark all laughing over how bad the drink tastes, he agrees with the taste, before bursting into laughter at the amount of bottles in the room, and telling the party to bring the whole town to try it. The townspeople all gather and try Boshaft, and as Fass sees the party off, he tells them that while the outcome was disappointing, he has never had as fun a night and he is glad they were there to try Boshaft with him.

## [TECHNIQUES] Golem Magic
**Golem magic** is a form of magic centered around creating golems for combat and support usage. The appearances and traits of these golems are dependent on the caster.

## Overview]

Golem magic has been known to mankind since over a millenium ago and since at least the Unified Empire era, where it was commonly utilized for military purposes. During this period, the Great Mage Flamme created a cooking golem that still functions in present day.

The golems created by mages through this magic can vary in construction, size, and capabilities, depending on the purpose of the golem and possibly the mage's proficiency at golem magic. The golems can be commanded with spells and function autonomously. Golems emit mana that is different from the mana emitted by monsters.

## Usage]

Golems can serve varying purposes depending on the intention of the caster, and they can achieve feats such as movement, spellcasting, and defense.

### Puppet Golems]

Frieren can create puppet golems using her **spell that manipulates stones as puppets** ｢石 (いし) を人 (にん) 形 (ぎょう) のように操 (あやつ) る魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Ishi o ningyō no yō ni ayatsuru mahō*?｣. She constructs these golems by attaching stones together, creating a roughly anthropomorphic figure, and she can manipulate their movements.

When Frieren talks to Stark about defeating the Solar Dragon, she recalls a past instance of her using the spell to create a dancing golem as entertainment for the Hero Party.

During Frieren's battle against her Spiegel clone in the Ruins of the King's Tomb, she also uses this spell to create a massive golem from the debris in the room, which she lands on to gain the high ground. The golem mirrors her offensive and defensive spells.

A version of this spell is also seen being used by two children to entertain themselves in Eiseberg during the Foundation Festival.

### Bottled Golems]

First-class mage Lernen utilizes golem magic to create bottled versions of his golems. By shrinking the golems and placing them in bottles, he is able to effectively transport and share them among other individuals.

#### Escape Golems]

During the second stage of the First-Class Mage Exam, located at the Ruins of the King's Tomb, Lernen designed a prototype of an **escape golem** ｢脱 (だっ) 出 (しゅつ) 用 (よう) ゴーレム, *Dasshutsuyō gōremu*?｣ for examinees to use. These golems are a form of his bottled golems, and Sense instructs the candidates to use them in the event of an emergency. 

The bottles provide convenient transport of the golems, and they can be released and expanded to their original forms upon shattering the bottles. The golems are sturdy with muscular frames and react swiftly when released. They are able to forcefully evacuate even incapacitated users out of dangerous zones to a previously defined location while simultaneously defending against threats. The golems are strong enough to break through walls and can use healing magic if the user is injured.

#### Combat Golems]

When Lernen and Edel face Macht, Lernen breaks a bottle containing a combat golem as a distraction against Macht. The combat golem is a massive golem that wears armor and wields a sword, and it is swift and possesses enormous strength.

### Cooking Golem]

The Great Mage Flamme created a **cooking golem** ｢調 (ちょう) 理 (り) 用 (よう) ゴーレム, *Chōriyō gōremu*?｣ during the Unified Empire era. It has a tall, arthropodic appearance with a long, curved, and segmented body and four arms with a basket on its back. Its head is round and has a large, circular eye. The golem is sturdy and harder than metal. If a meal is requested, it will collect the necessary ingredients autonomously. A spell needs to be cast to deactivate the golem.

### Military Golems]

**Military golem** ｢軍 (ぐん) 用 (よう) ゴーレム, *Gunyō gōremu*?｣ are golems created for military use. They were used as weapons during the Unified Empire era.

## [TECHNIQUES] Zoltraak
**Zoltraak** ｢一般攻撃魔法 (ゾルトラーク) , *Zorutorāku*?｣, alternatively known as **killing magic** ｢人を殺す魔法 (ゾルトラーク) , ***killing magic***?｣, **demon-killing magic** ｢魔族を殺す魔法 (ゾルトラーク) , ***demon-killing magic***?｣, or, in modern day, **ordinary offensive magic** ｢一 (いっ) 般 (ぱん) 攻 (こう) 撃 (げき) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Ippan kōgeki mahō*?｣, is a piercing spell that was originally developed by the demon Qual. The spell was later researched by humans and incorporated into their magic system, ultimately becoming a form of ordinary offensive magic that is used by modern mages.

## Overview]

Zoltraak was originally developed as a killing spell by the Elder Sage of Corruption, Qual, a member of the Demon King's army. The spell was known as the first piercing spell, and at the time, it was capable of piercing through humanity's defensive magic and magic-resistant equipment, directly devastating the individuals it struck. Eighty years prior to his death, Qual committed many atrocities in the region surrounding the Größe Forest with this spell, wiping out 40 percent of adventurers and 70 percent of mages in said region. 

Frieren of the Hero Party ultimately sealed Qual on the Hero Party's journey to defeat the Demon King. After Qual was petrified, mages across the continent began studying Zoltraak and eventually managed to incorporate it into the human magic system after a few years, with research of the spell spanning half a century. With the principles behind Zoltraak unraveled, new and powerful defensive spells and equipment were designed to counteract it. Additionally, Frieren, one of the major contributors towards this research, modified Zoltraak into a variant effective against demons—demon-killing magic—that she later taught to Fern. She unseals Qual when traveling with Fern and ultimately kills him with his own spell. Solitär implies that Zoltraak was used by humans to kill during the war in the Southern Lands, becoming the war's most lethal spell.

Due to how recently Zoltraak was assimilated into the present-day magic system, individuals born after the spell was integrated have learned to block it reflexively, as the spell is considered a fundamental element of their magic training. This poses an advantage against older mages, such as elves like Frieren or certain demons, as their experience with the spell in proportion to their ages means they have slightly delayed reactions defending against it.

## Usage]

Zoltraak is a simple spell that involves a blast of concentrated mana, either as a single shot or a saturation attack consisting of a barrage of Zoltraak casts. The size of the blast and the concentration or density of mana within a Zoltraak cast are adjustable, with highly concentrated spells appearing to be more powerful, though maintaining the speed is a difficult feat. When mages cast Zoltraak, they typically use a staff to direct the attack, but in some cases, they can cast the spell directly from their hand. A magic circle with a six-petaled flower indicates when Zoltraak is about to be cast.

Mages that are adept at casting magic quickly, such as Fern, can overwhelm opponents with a rapid-fire barrage of Zoltraak shots and prevent them from acquiring an opening. Additionally, these mages can cast a highly-concentrated Zoltraak from a distance to do damage while avoiding detection.

## Gallery]

## Trivia]

- The original version of Zoltraak—killing magic—is represented in the anime as a black blast of mana, while the other forms of Zoltraak are represented with white blasts.

- There appears to be multiple variations of the Zoltraak magic circle, such as a version with a star instead of a six-petaled flower in Chapter 5. However, the six-petaled flower is the most frequently seen version.

- Fern has been depicted with mana butterflies when casting Zoltraak.

## [LOCATIONS] Alt Woods
The **Alt Woods** ｢アルト森 (しん) 林 (りん) , *Aruto Shinrin*?｣ is a forest past the Appetit Region in the Northern Lands. It is the location of Sein and his brother's hometown.

## Overview]

### Terrain and Ecology]

The Alt Woods is a densely forested region with hills, rivers, and bottomless swamps. Various herbs in the woods can be foraged. The rivers are home to fish, while the woods are filled with wild fruits and herbs. The locality is shown to have farmlands used to produce abundant crops. As with most places in the Northern Lands, travelers may encounter dangerous creatures. Most notably, venomous creatures are present in the area. These include venomous snakes, one of which bites Stark and releases venom that can only be cured in the early stages.

### Village]

A small and modest village with some farmlands and a river is located within the Alt Woods, and it is Sein and his brother's hometown. Warrior Gorilla once lived in the village, but he set out ten years prior to adventure around the Northern Lands. In the autumn, the town holds a harvest festival.

## Synopsis]

### History]

Sein, his brother, and Gorilla grew up in the village in the Alt Woods. At some point early in their childhood, Sein and his brother's parents passed away. Sein's brother would take on the responsibility of caring for his brother. Both Sein and Gorilla had dreams of leaving the village and adventuring. They would often play rambunctiously in the village, and Sein would often share these dreams with his brother. When they were younger, a traveling mage visited the village and took a picture of Sein and Gorilla together using photo-taking magic. It is unknown when Sein and his brother began their work in the clergy, but they both grew up to be skilled with the Goddess's Magic.

Heiter visited the village while Sein was younger in an official capacity from the Holy City of Strahl. He conducted inspections of the church and assessed Sein's brother to be the best priest in the region and conferred upon him a Holy Symbol. He additionally invited Sein's brother to work in the Holy City, but Sein's brother refused, as he was fine with his life in the village and did not want to take Sein's hometown away from him. Sein overhears this and begins to feel guilty for the perceived sacrifice his brother made for him.

Ten years prior to Frieren's Party's visit to the village, Gorilla decided to go out and travel in the Northern Lands. He asked Sein to come with him, as they had both wanted to adventure since childhood. However, Sein refused him, and Gorilla stated that he will return in three years' time for the village's annual harvest festival. However, ten years go by without word from Gorilla, and Sein began to believe he was dead.

### Travels to Äußerst Arc]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's death, Frieren encounters Sein stuck in a swamp while she is gathering herbs. He tells her his ambition of becoming an adventurer, remembering in a flashback the time when his friend, Warrior Gorilla, tried to take him on an adventure. When Fern appears, Frieren remembers a spell to pull someone out of a bottomless swamp. Frieren's Party part ways with Sein near his village, and he warns them about the venomous animals in the forest. Shortly after that, Stark is bitten by a venomous snake. To get Stark cured, Frieren and Fern bring him to Sein's village. They visit the local church and meet Sein, who, as a priest, can treat the snake bite.

After seeing Sein's competency with the Goddess's Magic, Frieren is determined that Sein has to join her party. Stark attempts to convince Sein to join by visiting him in a bar. They both place bets, and Sein says he will join the party if Stark wins. However, the village chief wins the gamble and takes it all, leaving them humiliated in their underwear, and they receive help from Fern and Frieren. At that, Frieren remembers in a flashback how Himmel once convinced her to join the Hero Party.

The next days Frieren's party helps out in the village with various tasks while the harvest festival takes place. Sein rejects all attempts to convince him and declares he does not want to join the party. Frieren's party visits Sein's brother in the church to think of other approaches. Sein's brother tells them that Sein likes older ladies, prompting the idea to introduce Sein to an older lady: Frieren. Outside, Frieren attempts to flirt with Sein by using her master's secret technique: blowing him a kiss. It fails, which surprises Frieren, as she remembered how well Himmel was taken aback when she tried the technique on him. Sein repeats his intent to not become an adventurer. He reasons that he wishes not to leave his brother alone because his brother stayed in the village for him. Upon hearing this, Sein's brother is full of indignation, and he slaps Sein and tells him that he did not regret his choice to stay. He demands Sein to overthink his regrets. At last convinced, Sein decides to become an adventurer and joins the party on their journey to Aureole, with his goal being to find Gorilla.

## [LOCATIONS] Appetit Region
The **Appetit Region** ｢アぺティート地 (ち) 方 (ほう) , *Apetīto Chihō*?｣ is a mountainous region in the Northern Lands. It features snowy terrain, forests, and a town.

## Overview]

### Terrain and Ecology]

The Appetit Region has mountainous terrain, and its high altitude contributes to long winters and cold weather with regular snowfall. The vegetation is sparse, but coniferous trees grow within lush forests in the location. Human occupation is secluded and secured against dangerous wildlife. Domesticated cats and dogs are present, and cattle is raised. As with most places in the Northern Lands, travelers may encounter dangerous creatures.

### The Town]

A town in the Appetit Region houses a sizable population and contains many establishments. The buildings within the town appear to be built with primarily wood and stone.

## Synopsis]

### Travels to Äußerst Arc]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's death, on Stark's eighteenth birthday, Frieren and Fern discuss what to give him as birthday gifts. Frieren decides on a potion that melts clothes, which is quickly shut down by Fern, who pours it on her, leaving Frieren to find a new gift. For that, she combs once more through her suitcase.

Fern decides to investigate Stark on her own. She tracks his deeds done through the town and ends up meeting him. She then asks him directly what he desires. Stark mentions how he never received gifts growing up due to his weakness, and his brother, Stoltz, the best warrior in his hometown and the only one kind to Stark, was the one to fight against demons during an attack while he simply fled. Fern comforts him and they find a gift, a bracelet, that Stark chooses.

Stark and Fern return to the inn where Frieren is cooking giant hamburger steaks. Frieren reveals she received the recipe from Eisen, who had made them for the members of the Hero Party during their journey as a way of expressing gratitude towards their efforts as warriors on their birthdays. Eisen also always made steaks for Stark's birthday. Stark recalls his brother making a steak for his birthday as well and that his brother was the one who told him to run and escape the fateful night of the demon attack. In better spirits, he enjoys the rest of his birthday with his companions.

## [LOCATIONS] Aufgabe Federation
The **Aufgabe Federation** ｢アオフガーベ連 (れん) 峰 (ぽう) , *Aofugābe Renpō*?｣ is a region situated in Imperial Territory.

## Overview]

Aufgabe Federation is a region that consists of a muddy forest and a village. It has two paths leading to the Imperial Capital, one being a mountain path and the other a main road that was constructed about a year after the death of Himmel the Hero. This region is located south of the Imperial Capital.

The village is of decent size. Before the construction of the main road, adventurers used to frequent the village. While the village does not have an inn, it does feature a vacant inn. Additionally, the village has its own fields and a bar.

## Synopsis]

### History]

Around twenty-nine years before the death of Himmel the Hero, a group of Shadow Warriors from the Empire received orders to monitor the mountain path in the Aufgabe Federation and eliminate all individuals on a provided list. 

Approximately thirty years later, construction began on the main road in the Aufgabe Federation, which would prevent people from using the mountain path. One of these Shadow Warriors, Radaal, would eventually become the mayor of the village.

### Imperial Territory Travels Arc]

Thirty-one years after the death of the Hero Himmel, Frieren's Party stops in a village within the Aufgabe Federation. Radaal, the village's elderly mayor, welcomes them and offers a vacant cabin so that they can rest. While the villagers speak kindly of him, Frieren is suspicious of Radaal's intentions, as she recognizes him as a hardened warrior.

That night, Radaal confronts the party. He first encounters Stark, who is standing guard at the door, and knocks him out. He then storms into the cabin and temporarily subdues Frieren. However, Stark and Fern quickly fight back, and Frieren ultimately holds Radaal at bay with her staff. She convinces him to abandon his mission since no one remembers it anymore. Subsequently, Frieren's Party leaves the village under the cover of night, leaving Radaal to reflect on his choices.

The next morning, Frieren's Party is seen traveling to the Imperial Capital along the main road, which is covered in thick mud.

## [LOCATIONS] Aureole
**Aureole** ｢魂の眠る地 (オレオール) , *Oreōru*?｣, also referred to as **The Land Where Souls Rest** ｢魂 (たましい) の眠 (ねむ) る地 (ち) , *Tamashī no nemuru chi*?｣ or **Heaven**, is a gathering location for souls. It is located in the northernmost end of the continent, Ende, where the Demon King's Castle is also based.

## Overview]

Located in the Northern Lands, Aureole is a place humans refer to as "heaven"; a place where one could meet with the souls of the dead. Recorded in the notes of Flamme, Aureole is where Flamme visited and spoke with her old comrades. Upon reading Flamme's notes of this encounter, traveling north to Aureole and reuniting with Himmel became Frieren's goal for her new journey.

Due to Aureole being considered as the heaven of the world, it is presumed that the Goddess of Creation resides there.

## History]

At some point in her life, Flamme journeyed to Aureole and spoke with her former comrades. She documented the encounter in her notes for Frieren to refer to a thousand years in the future, guarding the notes with a long-lasting protection spell.

## Synopsis]

After Himmel's death, Heiter and Eisen correspond over mail, and Heiter discovers the location of a real and existing record of Flamme's notes that includes details of her being able to communicate with the dead.

Frieren and Fern visit Eisen to provide any assistance for him, and he requests their aid in looking for the Great Mage Flamme's notes in the Voll Basin. During their search, Eisen explains that he felt pity for Frieren over her regret surrounding not getting to know Himmel more, and their quest to find the notes was to help her directly express to Himmel her thoughts. The group manages to locate a giant tree covering ruins, and Frieren removes the protective barrier that surrounds it. Inside, they find the notes, and the book opens up to the page detailing Flamme's visit to Aureole, where she described her meeting with the souls of her old comrades. With persuasion from Eisen, Frieren decides to make Aureole her destination for the possibility of speaking with Himmel once again.

During their travels through the Northern Lands, Frieren and her party encounters Kraft, an Elf with strong faith in the Goddess of Creation. When Frieren tells him about their intended journey to Aureole, Kraft mentions his wish to be praised by the Goddess in heaven when he passes.

## [LOCATIONS] Bande Woods
The **Bande Woods** ｢バンデ森 (しん) 林 (りん) , *Bande Shinrin*?｣ is a dense forest situated in the Northern Lands.

## Overview]

### Terrain and Ecology]

The Bande Woods is a dense forest of mostly deciduous trees, some creeks, and wildlife, including herbs, fungi, and boar-like creatures. Dangerous monsters roam the area, including a bird-like monster that hunts by slamming prey into the ground. The wagon Frieren's Party travels in is hunted by this monster, forcing them to spend a few days on reparations.

## Synposis]

### Travels to Äußerst Arc]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's death, Frieren's Party travel through the Bande Woods by catching a ride on a wagon with an accessory merchant. Frieren discusses the bracelet Stark bought for Fern for her birthday, which shares the same mirrored lotus flower design as a ring Himmel previously gifted Frieren. Their discussion is interrupted by an attack from a bird-like monster, who lifts their wagon in the air. Frieren jumps out of the wagon and blasts the monster in midair, dropping them to the ground and damaging the wagon in the process.

While the party repairs the wagon, Frieren realizes she has lost Himmel's ring. Meanwhile, Sein reveals that the mirrored lotus represents eternal love, much to Stark's dismay and Fern's annoyance at his reaction. After the wagon is fixed, Fern realizes that Frieren lost her ring and assists her in searching for it. With the aid of a spell for finding lost accessories from the merchant, Frieren locates the ring. As the party proceeds onwards through the woods, Frieren reflects on how she obtained the ring and that she is happy she did not give up on finding it.

## [LOCATIONS] Bier Region
The **Bier Region** ｢ビーア地 (ち) 方 (ほう) , *Bīa Chihō*?｣ is a region situated in the Northern Plateau.

## Overview]

The Bier Region is one of the more populated areas of the Northern Plateau, featuring fertile lands ideal for agriculture. Notably, it hosts the only granary in the entire Northern Plateau.

### The Town]

The town is quite populated, especially considering its location within the dangerous Northern Plateau. It boasts numerous bars and, thanks to the granary and local brewing activities, is relatively prosperous. Various shops can also be found throughout the area.

### The Mine]

The mine that Fass dug after hearing a legend that claimed Boshaft was preserved somewhere nearby. His efforts led him to uncover a stone monument with an inscription in ancient elvish, which confirmed his beliefs.

#### Milliarde's Boshaft Stash]

A room containing Milliarde's stash of Boshaft within the mine is located near the original monument. The stash was uncovered by Fass after two hundred years of searching.

## Synopsis]

### History]

Over a millennium before the death of Himmel the Hero, Milliarde decides to kill some time and carves an inscription in the Bier Region that describes Boshaft as the finest spirit. She also places a storage full of Boshaft near the inscription, and places a powerful barrier over it.

### Continued Northern Travels Arc]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's death, Frieren's Party travels through the Bier Region and stops in a town to stock up on supplies. While there, they meet Fass, who persuades Frieren to help him uncover Boshaft. He informs them about the inscription and the ruins he discovered. Although Frieren initially refuses to assist, even with the offer of twenty Reich gold coins, she later changes her mind, encouraged by Stark and Fern.

For the next three months, Frieren's Party stays in the town and successfully dispels the barrier. Once they open the door to the ruins and find Boshaft, Fass takes a sip. He struggles to describe the taste, prompting Frieren to declare it awful—worse than any alcohol she has ever encountered. Noticing that Stark hasn't tasted it yet, she forces him to take a sip. Stark reacts with shock at the terrible flavor, which leads to laughter among the party.

Fass reflects on the drink’s taste and laughs, claiming there is enough for everyone in the village to share. Later, Fass and the party are seen enjoying the drink with the rest of the villagers. Although Fass admits it was a disappointing outcome, he insists it was the most fun evening he's ever had. As they leave the town, he concludes that if one is going to drink, they might as well enjoy it to the fullest.

More than seven years into the Hero Party's journey, Himmel defeated a 10-meter-long serpent near Bohne Village.

After the defeat of the Demon King, the Hero Party passed through Bohne Village on their return to the Royal Capital. While in the village, they overheard a story that exaggerated the serpent's size, turning the 10-meter creature Himmel had slain into a 100-meter-long beast.

Thirty-one years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Frieren's Party arrives in Bohne Village during the Liberation Festival, a celebration marking the anniversary of the Demon King's defeat. The village mayor invites Frieren, Fern, and Stark to stay for the festivities.

During the festival, they visit a statue of Himmel, which is believed to bring good luck if touched. Upon arrival, they notice that the statue has been completely altered. Frieren explains that this is typical in Imperial Territory, where the Empire often deifies deceased heroes. Though Stark feels uneasy about the changes, Frieren reassures him that the villagers mean no harm and sincerely revere Himmel.

## Overview]

The Bredt Region is located in the Central Lands with farmlands and forests. It is in close vicinity to the Northern Lands, and the Voll Basin is located within the region.

### Terrain and Ecology]

The region is surrounded by ridges and contains some settlements. On the central plane grows the deep forest, which is where the notes of the Great Mage Flamme are supposedly hidden. There are different geological features, with the Voll Basin being the most notable, and it provides habitats for multiple species. Humans settle the area and use it for farmlands. Within the Voll Basin is a deep forest, featuring mixed woods, where wildlife like lizards and grapes can be found. A peculiarity is the huge, thousand-year-old tree enhanced under protective magic, which Flamme planted as a guardian of her dwelling.

### Eisen's House]

Eisen's house is a small, wooden cabin in the region . It is a house with a single room, windows, a table with multiple chairs, a drawer, and a bed. Outside of the house lies the graves of Eisen's family, who were killed in a demon attack.

#### Ruins]

A building within the deep forest of the Voll Basin, which houses the notes of the Great Mage Flamme. A tree planted over a thousand years ago by Flamme and Frieren has grown over it.

## Synopsis]

### History]

At some point during Frieren's mentorship under Flamme, Flamme planted a tree that she intended to act as the guardian of a building, which in the present has been reduced to ruins. Frieren commented that the tree did not appear to be a reliable guardian, to which Flamme responded that it will protect the place for more than a millennium once it fully grows. Frieren replied that by then, Flamme will be dead. Flamme advised Frieren that Frieren herself won't be dead, and one day when Frieren makes a grave mistake, what Flamme left behind will guide her.

During the Hero Party's journey to defeat the Demon King, they visited Eisen's house in the region, which contained two graves that turned out to be Eisen's family. Heiter proceeded to pray for Eisen's family, and the party discussed Heiter's belief in Heaven's existence, which both Eisen and Frieren are skeptic about. Frieren mentioned that since magic is not yet capable of visualizing the souls of the deceased, the idea of Heaven cannot be proven. Himmel responded that he does not mind either way, a sentiment that Heiter agrees with, to Himmel's confusion. Heiter explained that even if Heaven does not exist, then he will still believe it does, because he would prefer it for those who struggled so hard to live. Himmel voiced his agreement, and the Hero Party then pray for Eisen's family.

At some point after the journey of the Hero Party and around three years before Frieren and Fern come to visit Eisen takes in Stark making him his apprentice. Eisen teaches him his technique. After an event where Eisen hits Stark, the boy leaves to end up in the Riegel Canyon.

### Beyond Journey's End Arc]

Twenty-eight years after the Himmel's death, Frieren and Fern travel to the Bredt Region. They visit Eisen at his house, where he can be seen praying near the graves of his family. As they chat and catch up on each others' lives, Eisen is surprised to see that Frieren has taken in an apprentice, and Frieren learns that Eisen and Heiter had been exchanging letters.

Afterwards, they start traveling to the Voll Basin, which is supposedly where the notes of the Great Mage Flamme reside, as discovered by Heiter in his research. Frieren directs them to look for a large tree, an effort which takes them at least a day. Underneath the tree from 1000 years ago are ruins, which contain the notes of Flamme. They retrieve the notes, and Frieren also reveals that she was an apprentice of Flamme.

Within the notes, Flamme reveals that Heaven does, in fact, exist at a location called Aureole, the place where souls rest in the northernmost part of the continent. Frieren realizes that Aureole will therefore be within Ende, where the Demon King's Castle also stands. Eisen asks Frieren to go to Aureole and talk to Himmel. Frieren agrees to this, though she is discouraged by the frigid temperatures in the north.

While on the way back to his house, Eisen asks Fern if Frieren is a good teacher, which she is initially unsure about. However, she eventually responds that despite Frieren's flaws, Frieren has been trying to understand her, and thus she considers Frieren a good teacher.

The carriage later drops them off at Eisen's house, and Frieren voices her surprise that Eisen is choosing not go on the journey with them, to which he maintains that he will be nothing but a burden. Frieren and Fern decide they will use the same path the Hero Party took, which will take then ten years. They then depart for their adventure.

## Overview]

### Terrain and Ecology]

The Decke Region is located near the Schwer Mountains in the Northern Lands, and it has rough, mountainous terrain and forests with snowstorms. Due to its elevated altitude, the onset of cold and snowy seasonal weather in winter is early and lasts long. The area becomes dangerous without shelter.

The vegetation within the region is sparse, and, due to the snowstorms, they are frequently covered under snow. The forests consist of coniferous trees. There appears to be no human occupation or usage of the land besides a lone cabin. Many wildlife species can be found, such as hare-like and fox-like creatures and a form of seed rats adapted to the location. In the forest, typical foraged foods like berries and nuts can be gathered. As with most places in the Northern Lands, travelers may encounter dangerous creatures.

### Cabin]

A small, one-room cabin is located within the Decke Region at the foot of the mountains. It is used by adventurers as a shelter in the event of a snowstorm. It is visited by Frieren in her travels during the fifty years between the two Era Meteors she watches with the Hero Party and by Frieren's Party and Kraft when they are stranded for half a year by the winter weather. It appears to be regularly maintained.

Stark collapses and there is a heavy snowstorm, so they seek shelter in a cabin Frieren remembers was there eighty years ago. As they open the door, they see an elf doing squats inside, and quickly close the door. Fern protests staying in the cabin and asks Frieren to find another place, but before they can, the elf opens the door and asks Frieren if she is an elf.

Inside the cabin, the elf, who is named Kraft, has a conversation with Frieren about the rarity of encountering another elf. Due to Stark's low body temperature, Kraft helps warm him up by sleeping with him, leading to Stark waking up in confusion. After the misunderstanding is settled, Stark compliments Kraft on his build. 

Due to the current condition of the weather, the four of them stay in the cabin. To survive, they gather supplies from Kraft's wagon, hunt, and forage for food during the stay. They share their meals together and Kraft teaches Fern and Stark various things. One day, while in the forest, Kraft and Frieren have a discussion on the Goddess of Creation, spurred by Kraft asking Frieren to give a necklace to Fern for her strong devotion. 

Months later, once the winter has passed and the mountain is traversable again, Frieren's party and Kraft part ways as they continue their separate adventures.

The **Empire** ｢帝 (てい) 国 (こく) , *Teikoku*?｣ is a country in the Northern Lands that once united the majority of the continent. Its capital is Eiseberg.

## Overview]

### Eiseberg]

*Main article: Eiseberg*

## History]

The Empire was once the largest human nation on the continent, having been around during the time of the early days of the Demon King when his armies freely marauded across the land and warred with humanity without restrain. Like a majority of human society during this time, the Empire did not think highly of magic as a whole due to the influence, excessive usage, and extreme mastery of it by Demons to kill and terrorize humanity. As such, all forms of magic were deemed to be demonic techniques, and thus, open research on these techniques was considered taboo.

However, Flamme, a human mage and former apprentice of the immensely powerful mage Serie, was able to influence the Emperor to approve the research of magic country-wide, and she helped establish and educate a new division of Imperial Mages. Flamme was thus responsible for helping to usher in an era in which all of mankind would be able to use magic and acquire the power to oppose the Demon King's army. For this, Flamme is known as the founder of mankind's magic.

Due to Flamme's contributions, the Empire flourished and evolved its magic, which became integrated as an everyday aspect of the Empire's way of life. The Empire developed and increased their military prowess by applying magic to their armies and continued to expand and research magic for military purposes for the next few centuries, building legions of trained mages with enough power to topple entire countries. To counteract any possibility of rebellion and uprising by these powerful mages, secret anti-magic units were established, with the Magic Special Forces being one unit officially acknowledged by the Empire. Other rumored units included the Shadow Warriors and the Court of the Sacred Staff.

## [LOCATIONS] Etwas Mountains
The **Etwas Mountains** ｢エトヴァス山 (さん) 地 (ち) , *Etovasu Sanchi*?｣ are a mountainous region situated in the Northern Lands. It lies in what was once a volcanic area. In the past, the mountains were known for their hot springs and attracted many adventurers.

## Overview]

The Etwas Mountains are located in the Northern Lands, in a volcanic area where eruptions once occurred, though none have happened for centuries. Due to this inactivity and the region's warmer climate, the Etwas Mountains were once famous for their hot springs, which attracted many adventurers. However, the hot springs dried up at some point before the death of Himmel the Hero, causing adventurers to stop visiting. As a result, the area's inhabitants left, and the villages were abandoned.

## Synopsis]

### History]

During their journey to defeat the Demon King, the Hero Party passed through the Etwas Mountains and a village where they experienced the region's hot springs. While there, they sought the secret hot spring of the Etwas Mountains, which required them to traverse the territory of a monster. This journey was particularly challenging, with both Frieren and Eisen wanting to turn back. Upon finding the hot spring, they discovered it was merely a foot bath. Nevertheless, they sat and enjoyed the view of the mountains before leaving.

### Continued Northern Travels Arc]

Twenty-nine years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Frieren's Party travels through the Etwas Mountains in search of the old village that Frieren visited. They find only a single cabin, which worries Frieren. A resident of the cabin informs them that the village was abandoned over thirty years ago, and that the only remaining hot spring may be the secret hot spring of the Etwas Mountains. This prompts Frieren to consider departing for the next town, but Stark convinces her to search for the secret hot spring instead. 

 
While on their journey to find it, they enter the territory of a three-headed dragon and manage to fend it off. When they finally locate the hot spring, Stark and Fern discover that the water is shallow. Frieren explains that this is why she was hesitant to search for it. Despite this, Stark decides to enter the spring anyway and encourages them to join him. As they relax in the secret hot spring, Stark reveals that he heard about this place from his master, who told him that the journey was not worth the effort, though he cherished the memory and would never forget the view from that day.

On their way back, Fern comments on how the return journey is just as harsh, and Stark remarks that perhaps it was not worth it after all.

## [LOCATIONS] Fabel Village
**Fabel Village** ｢ファーベル村 (むら) , *Fāberu Mura*?｣ is a village located in the Northern Lands.

## Overview]

Fabel Village is a village situated in a forested area of the Northern Lands. The village has on one side fields for crops adjacent to it, and on the other, it is situated beside tall hills with near-vertical slopes. The inhabitants raise animals like geese. In the village's plaza, there is a statue of the Hero of the South. The plaza also serves as a venue for community events where acts like puppet theater performances, which depict the battle between the Hero of the South and Schlacht the Omniscient, can take place.

 

## Synopsis]

### History]

Many years ago, during the war against the Demon King, the Hero of the South liberated Fabel Village from the Demon armies and the Seven Sages of Destruction. Fabel Village was one of many villages freed by the Hero during his one year-long campaign, which ended with his death at the hands of Schlacht the Omniscient and the Sages. Although the Hero of the South did not defeat the Demon King, the faith in him within Fabel Village remains strong. The absence of his corpse has led to legends that he continues to fight against Schlacht the Omniscient to the present day.

### Continued Northern Travels Arc]

Twenty-nine years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Frieren and her party receive a request from the Chief of Fabel Village to clean the statue of the village's Hero. Frieren agrees after being offered a spell to scratch the itchy parts on your back". As Stark prepares to polish the statue, expecting another statue of Himmel, he is shocked to find a statue of a middle-aged man. 

Frieren then explains to Fern and Stark that the statue depicts the Hero of the South. She elaborates that many heroes challenged the Demon King, and among them, the Hero of the South was said to have been the strongest Hero of humanity. Stark initially thinks this sounds exaggerated, but Frieren assures him it is not, emphasizing that he deserved that title.

Frieren recounts that during the long war against the Demon King, the Hero of the South made significant progress, as within a single year, he destroyed the frontline forces of the Demon King and advanced to the northernmost end of the Northern Plateau, which served as the central supply route for the Demon King's army. It was here that he was besieged by Schlacht the Omniscient and all of the Seven Sages of Destruction, leading to his demise, though he managed to slay Schlacht and three of the Sages before falling. 

After Frieren concludes her tale, they clean the statue of the Hero of the South and receive their reward from the village chief. Soon after, villagers gather around the newly polished statue as Frieren and her party watch contentedly.

## [LOCATIONS] Graf Dach's Domain
**Graf Dach's Domain** ｢ダッハ伯 (はく) 爵 (しゃく) 領 (りよう) , *Dahha Hakushaku-ryō*?｣ is a holding under the rule of nobleman Graf Dach, located in the Northern Lands. Its seat of power lies in a large, fortified town.

## Overview]

The main town in Graf Dach's Domain is large and well-developed, featuring numerous houses, shops, magic shops, and inns. The settlement also serves as the center of Graf Dach's rule, housing his castle with defensive wall and towers. Surrounding the town are several areas under Graf Dach's control, including at least one village, a large forest, and a flowing river. Snakes inhabit these areas as well.

 

### The castle]

Graf Dach's castle has several floors featuring numerous rooms, like a big dining hall and includes a stable for horses and a coach. In a separate room on a stand with the coat of arms, with a sword over mountains on a blue ground behind it, the Dach's family's treasured heirloom, the sword that once belonged to a prominent demon, is kept.

## Synopsis]

### History]

During their quest to subjugate the Demon King, the Hero Party passed through Graf Dach's Domain and met the great-grandfather of the current Graf Dach, who ruled at that time. The Graf tasked the party with recovering the family's treasured heirloom sword, which once belonged to a notable demon. The Dach family, known for their assertiveness, often made unreasonable requests, and the noble threatened the Hero Party with execution if they failed to return the sword. The party then had to travel back to the Schwer Mountains to recover it. In return for their efforts, they were handsomely rewarded with money.

### Continued Northern Travels Arc]

Twenty-nine years after the passing of Himmel the Hero, Frieren and her party pass through the largest town in Graf Dach's Domain. Stark comments on how long it has been since they visited such a large settlement, while Frieren wishes to leave as soon as possible, much to the surprise of both Stark and Fern.

Shortly after, the party is invited to dinner by Graf Dach, which Frieren reluctantly agrees to attend. At the banquet, Graf Dach promptly requests their help in retrieving the family heirloom sword, which has been stolen by a demon, with Frieren noting that the same happened to his great-grandfather. Frieren agrees in exchange for a grimoire as a reward.

Frieren and her companions search through a nearby forest and come across an abandoned village. There, they meet a priestess who claims to have buried the villagers killed by a demon. However, Frieren uncovers that the graves are empty, revealing the priestess as the demon who stole Graf Dach's sword. The party swiftly defeats the demon. Afterwards, they pay their respects to the fallen villagers and offer prayers for them.

Upon their return to Graf Dach's castle, they hand over the heirloom sword and claim their promised reward. As they leave the town, Stark asks Frieren about the spell in the grimoire, to which she replies that it teaches a spell to turn a red apple to a green apple.

## [LOCATIONS] Graf Granat's Domain
**Graf Granat's Domain** ｢グラナト伯 (はく) 爵 (しゃく) 領 (りょう) , *Guranato Hakushaku-ryō*?｣ is a fortified city and the surrounding region in the Northern Lands. It is a holding under the rule of the nobleman Graf Granat

## Overview]

Graf Granat's Domain consists of a fortified city and the land around it, ruled by the nobleman Graf Granat. A wall surrounds the settlement, with the Graf's mansion being centrally located. It has a dungeon to incarcerate offenders. The city features a church, many shops, houses, and inns, and is overall a prosperous town. It is protected by a defensive barrier, erected by the Great Mage Flamme a thousand years prior, that keeps monsters at bay.

### Terrain and Ecology]

The region around Graf Granat's Domain has mostly hilly terrain with snow-glazed mountains in the distance and a forest with majorly coniferous trees. In the town are domesticated animals, such as cats, and outside the barrier of the domain, there are dangerous creatures such as flying monsters and demons. Aura, one of the Seven Sages of Destruction and a demon at war against Graf Granat, devasted the surrounding forest with her undead army of withered soldiers and her henchman Lügner, Linie, and Draht.

### The Dungeon]

The dungeon is a brick-walled dungeon with several cells to incarcerate offenders. A guard is stationed outside the entrance. Each cell appears to have a flat bench and horizontal beams supporting the ceiling.

### The Graf's Mansion]

Graf Granat's mansion is a walled estate with a building several stories high. It features rooms of various sizes, such as a guest room with a balcony. In the house is also the room of Graf Granat's late son, which the Graf regularly cleans. He also displays a sword, granted to him after fighting in a duel, as the only thing that came back when his son died.

## Synopsis]

### History]

On the quest to defeat the Demon King, the Hero Party arrived near Graf Granat's Domain. They had a skirmish with Aura the Guillotine and wounded her, leaving her to flee and go into hiding.

After Himmel's death, Aura reappeared and waged war against Graf Granat, which led to the death of his son ten years prior to the arrival of Frieren's Party.

### Aura the Guillotine Arc]

Twenty-eight years after Himmel's passing, Frieren's Party enter the main town of Graf Granat's Domain. As the trio walks into town, Frieren senses some demons and tries to kill them, but she is stopped by guards. The three demons, led by Lügner, are supposedly peace envoys, but Frieren tells Lügner that he and the other demons are savage monsters that only mimic human speech. Frieren is thrown into the dungeon for attempting to attack the messengers, and Fern and Stark investigate the situation in the town, learning that Aura the Guillotine, a demon who served the Demon King as one of the Seven Sages of Destruction, has requested peace after being long at war with the town. They relay this information to Frieren, but Frieren states that it is futile to negotiate with the demons, as they only use words as a means of deception rather than communication. She decides to break out of the dungeon once the disorder starts. Meanwhile, Lügner wonders where he has seen Frieren before and smiles as she is the only one who knows the true nature of demons.

Graf Granat brings the demons into his late son's old room and tells them about him. He takes a sword on display, the only thing that came back after his son's death, and threatens the demons as vengeance for his son, declaring that he has no intention of reconciliation. However, Lügner claims that his father was also killed in the war, leading to Graf Granat emphasizing with him. Once the Graf leaves, Lügner explains to the one of the other envoys, the demon girl Linie, that his claim was actually a lie to placate the Graf. Meanwhile, the third envoy demon, Draht, goes to the dungeon to try to assassinate Frieren and decapitates a guard stationed outside in the process. He fails, and she is able to kill him easily. As Frieren exits the cell, she discovers the dead guard.

While Frieren is in the dungeon, Fern and Stark sit outside of a restaurant and plan their next actions, ultimately deciding that they will try and appeal to the Graf for Frieren's release. Back in the mansion's guest room, Lügner and Linie realizes Draht had been killed after being unable to detect his mana. They reconvene with the Graf and his guards, where Graf Granat discusses the escape of Frieren and the death of a guard. He then confronts Lügner, suspecting that Draht had beheaded the guard, as Frieren, who had allowed herself to be peacefully captured despite being a skilled mage, would understand the punishment associated with killing a guard. With his original plan now futile, Lügner reveals his true colors, killing the guards and wounding Graf Granat with his blood magic. Lügner tells the Graf his actual intention: removing the protective barrier surrounding the town.

As Fern and Stark head to the Graf's mansion, they notice a cloaked Frieren, who updates them and states that she will escape town to avoid punishment as the main suspect for the guard's death. Fern requests Frieren to not abandon the town, but Frieren tells her that the two of them are capable of dealing with Lügner and Linie. Frieren then sets her eye on Aura, who is at the outskirts the town with her undead army.

In the evening, Fern and Stark enter the Graf's mansion to kill the demons. Meanwhile, Lügner and Linie try to find a way to dispel the barrier through questioning the Graf, who is bound to a chair. Lügner gives him time to think, and he and Linie search for a grimoire that can dispel the barrier within the mansion. After the demons leave, Stark enters the room and tries to free the Graf. However, Lügner and Linie return from their search during the process, and Stark attempts to fight them. Lügner pins him down with his magic, but he does not detect Fern, who appears behind the window and blasts him with Zoltraak, severely wounding him. Given the severity of the Graf's wounds, Fern and Stark end up retreating. Linie attempts to pursue them, but Lügner advises her not to go alone, as he suspects that the magic that Fern used is from Frieren the Slayer, the mage that has led the most demons to their graves. In the meantime, Frieren arrives at the outskirts of the domain and confronts Aura and her army.

Fern, Stark, and the Graf make it to the town's church, where the Graf's wounds are treated. Fern and Stark go outside to evacuate the town and bring back Frieren, but Fern discovers mana on their blood-stained clothes on the way. They are promptly attacked by Lügner and Linie, and Linie knocks Stark off the building with an axe she conjured, leaving Fern to fight against Lügner and his blood magic, Balterie. Stark realizes Linie's magic, Erfassen, allows her to copy the movements of past warriors she had analyzed, including Eisen's, and he gets beaten down to the ground two times by her attacks. However, he realizes his master's technique dealt heavier blows than Linie's imitation, and he finishes her off with his **Lightning Strike** technique. With Lügner distracted by Linie's defeat, Fern is able to deal a deadly wound to him with Zoltraak. She casts the final blow to Lügner shortly after he notices that Fern and her master both suppress their mana.

As Fern and Stark battle against the envoys, Frieren face off against Aura outside of the town. Aura sends her army to attack Frieren, but she evades the attacks of the undead soldiers and releases some of them with dispelling magic, which removes the influence of Aura's Scales of Obedience. After a conversation with Frieren, Aura casts her Auserlese spell, which places her soul and Frieren's soul on the Scales of Obedience. Confident in her victory, Aura walks towards Frieren and takes up a sword from an undead soldier to personally behead the elf. However, the balance of the scales shifts, and Frieren reveals that she was suppressing her mana for over a thousand years, much longer than Aura's 500 years of life, and she releases her true mana. Having tipped the Scales in her favor, Frieren takes control of Aura. She commands the demon to kill herself, which she forcefully obeys by decapitating herself.

After the victory over Aura and her henchman, the town celebrates. Frieren, Fern, and Stark receive treatment for their wounds and help rebuild the damages. A commemoration is arranged, where Frieren receives a grimoire and Fern and Stark receive new winter outfits as gifts. At their farewell, the party discusses the next step: entering the Locations#Northern Plateau, which requires them to be accompanied by a first-class mage. Frieren and Fern thus decide to take the First-Class Mage Exam in Äußerst.

### First-Class Mage Exam Arc]

Around the same time Frieren, Fern and Stark reach the city of Äußerst, three months prior to the First-Class Mage Exam, Übel meets Kraft on the road by Graf Granat's Domain. After a brief interaction with Kraft, Übel continues traveling north to Äußerst.

## [LOCATIONS] Granz Channel
The **Granz Channel** ｢グランツ海 (かい) 峡 (きょう) , *Gurantsu Kaikyō*?｣ is a body of water in the Central Lands. Near the coast of the Granz Channel lies a small village, which Frieren and Fern visit.

## Overview]

The Granz Channel is used as a passageway for ships, and on the first sunrise of the new year, the Granz Channel becomes very picturesque because of the sunlight reflected on the untainted sea. Viewing this has been the tradition of the village situated near the cliffs on the coast of the Granz Channel.

### Terrain and Ecology]

The region around the Granz Channel has low vegetation with some sparse trees spread in the area, and the channel itself has a beach rim in. The villagers grow greenery and colorful flowers in flower pots and planters. Aquatic species, such as seaweed and other water plants, are part of the ecosystem, feeding fish and other creatures like starfish. 

### The Village]

On the cliffs overlooking the coast of the Granz Channel lies a small village. The village has plenty of houses, shops, inns, and a church.

The village has a tradition of watching the New Year's sunrise because of how picturesque the Granz Channel looks. The coast was initially littered with shipwrecks that washed up on shore until Frieren and Fern were hired to clean the coast up. As payment, they received the only grimoire in the village, which was supposedly from the Great Mage Flamme.

## Synopsis]

### History]

During the time of the Hero Party's journey, the party stopped in the Granz Channel during the New Year's festival. At the time, the coastline was free of debris. Himmel wanted the party to watch the sunrise together, but Frieren slept in instead, as she didn't see the value of getting up early just to see a sunrise. 

This would later cause Himmel to gently rebuke her by stating that Heiter was so disappointed that his condition had deteriorated from the sadness, though in reality, it was the result of a hangover. Frieren interjects that she doesn't see what the big deal is, since the rest of the party was able to see the sunrise and she personally did not think it would have been fun. However, Himmel tells Frieren that the party had wanted her to enjoy the sunrise as well, and that she would have had fun because that is who she is.

### Beyond Journey's End Arc]

Frieren and Fern are hired to clean the coast of the village next to the Granz Channel, with a supposed grimoire from the Great Mage Flamme as a reward. They commence cleaning operations and, after clearing the coast for over three months, finish just in time for the New Year's sunrise.

Frieren is awoken by Fern to see the sunrise, and she thinks back to when she and the Hero Party were there and did not participate in the sunrise viewing. Decades later, with Fern, she now understands the beauty in viewing the sight with others.

## [LOCATIONS] Great Sanft Forest
The **Great Sanft Forest** ｢ザンフト大 (だい) 森 (しん) 林 (りん) , *Zanfuto Daishinrin*?｣ is a heavily forested region located in the Northern Lands.

## Overview]

The Great Sanft Forest is situated in the Northern Lands. A small river runs through this heavily forested region with deciduous trees. The region's main road splits at a fork, with one branch leading to Neutral Harbor and the other to the Northern Plateau. A small settlement lies at this junction, with an inn where adventurers can rest. The inn’s hanging sign bears the letters “WG.”

## Synopsis]

### Continued Northern Travels Arc]

Twenty-nine years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Stark returns to the campsite of Frieren's Party, hoping his foraged food is enough for lunch. However, he finds that both Fern and Frieren are missing, so he decides to catch some big fish. Meanwhile, Fern and Frieren are bathing and cleaning their belongings in a river. Stark eventually finds them there while on his way to fish.

Shortly thereafter, the group continues their journey and arrives at a fork where one path leads to Neutral Harbor and the other to the Northern Plateau. Nearby, they find an inn where they decide to rest. While there, they reunite with Wirbel, Ehre, and Scharf. After a brief exchange, Wirbel asks Frieren if he can try to convince Stark to temporarily join them in their fight against demons on the Northern Frontier. Although Fern is reluctant, Frieren agrees to let Wirbel proceed.

Later, Fern talks with Stark, who reveals that he turned down Wirbel's request. He confesses that when Fern and Frieren first met him near Riegel Canyon, he was at his breaking point and considered abandoning the village. He shares that Fern’s encouragement that night motivated him to stay and asks her to be nicer to him.

The next day, Frieren and her party bid farewell to Wirbel and his group as both continue on their respective journeys—Wirbel and his team heading to Neutral Harbor to reach the Imperial Capital, while Frieren and her party continue on their way to the Northern Plateau.

## [LOCATIONS] Great Tor Canyon
The **Great Tor Canyon** ｢トーア大 (だい) 渓 (けい) 谷 (こく) , *Tōa Daikeikoku*?｣ is a vast canyon located in the Northern Plateau. It is said to be the deepest canyon on the continent.

## Overview]

The Great Tor Canyon is the deepest canyon on the continent, with a precipice reaching 3000 meters. From the top, the canyon's floor is barely visible. Its existence is made possible by the high elevation of the Northern Plateau. Due to the strong winds that sweep through the canyon, crossing it with flying magic is impossible.

One specific detour around the Great Tor Canyon requires crossing a river on the upper reaches, and navigating a steep mountain range. Further downriver, the canyon ends in a sheer cliff, 3000 meters high, that drops into the ocean. Circumventing the entire canyon would take roughly two weeks. 

Due to a newly constructed bridge that spans the canyon upriver, both sides are now connected, facilitating easier travel across the canyon.

To the south of the Great Tor Canyon lies Lake Korridor, while the Schmal Snowfield and the Weise Region are situated to the north. Additionally, a city with a garrison is located nearby to provide defense. On the opposite side of the canyon from this city lies Gehen's village.

## Synopsis]

### History]

During their quest to subjugate the Demon King, the Hero Party arrived at the Great Tor Canyon and discovered that Gehen's bridge was still under construction. Due to Gehen's lack of funds, Himmel offered him the monetary reward they had received from Graf Dach for retrieving his heirloom sword. Although Gehen initially hesitated, stating that he could not accept the reward because Himmel would likely be long dead by the time the bridge was completed, Himmel insisted that Frieren could take the reward on his behalf. He instructed Gehen to ensure that the bridge was built to last a thousand years, to which Gehen readily agreed.

### The Golden Land Arc]

Thirty years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Frieren and her party arrive at the Great Tor Canyon. Remembering Gehen's bridge, Frieren takes Fern and Stark upriver to check on its status. There, Gehen informs her that bird monsters have been attacking anyone who attempts to cross the bridge. In exchange for a spell that lets you flip pancakes perfectly, Frieren's party agrees to exterminate the bird monster nest and succeed, ensuring that everyone can safely cross the Great Tor Canyon.

## [LOCATIONS] Grobe Basin
The **Grobe Basin** ｢グローブ盆 (ぼん) 地 (ち) , *Gurōbu Bonchi*?｣ is a forested basin situated in the Kühl Region in the Northern Lands. Its lake and the area around it serves as the test location for the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam in Äußerst, proctored by Genau. A barrier was placed over a large portion of the basin for the exam.

## Overview]

### Terrain and Ecology]

The Grobe Basin is located within the Kühl Region in the Northern Lands. It sits on a lower plane surrounded by hills with caves and mountains, and creeks and rivers flow into a central lake. The area is densely forested with deciduous trees and much undergrowth. The basin features rich wildlife, including beasts and meteoric iron birds, Stilles. Dangerous creatures are also present, such as the Geisel.

## Synopsis]

### First-Class Mage Exam (First Stage)]

*Main article: First-Class Mage Exam*

Twenty-nine years after Hero Himmel's passing, 57 examinees of the First-Class Mage Exam, including Frieren and Fern, are divided into groups of three for the first stage of the exam. In Frieren's group, titled the second party, are Kanne and Lawine, while Fern's group, the fourth party, consists of her, Übel, and Land. Genau, the first-class mage proctoring the test, chooses the Grobe Basin as the location for the first stage. He announces that the goal of the exam is to capture a Stille—a meteoric iron bird that can fly faster than the speed of sound—in a cage by sunset the next day, with the caveat that all party members must be present. Because the Stille is sensitive to mana and the birds' own mana is difficult to detect, many participants are forced into battles with each other in order to try to secure a bird. Additionally, the participants need to take into account the geographical features of the basin,, including the barrier placed by Serie that prevents rain and river water from entering the basin, as well as the ecology of the basin, especially the Geisel aerial monsters.

Because the young mages in Frieren's group bicker, she is forced to take the lead. They introduce themselves to each other, and Frieren says she has some knowledge of the Stille but has never seen one herself. The group investigates the area for signs of a Stille. When they take a break, Lawine declares herself stronger than Kanne and goes scouting ahead to find a Stille. Frieren tells Lawine to be careful of the sky, which confuses Kanne. Lawine manages to find a Stille and leads Kanne and Frieren to a small body of water. Kanne uses her water magic to surround the bird, and Lawine promptly freezes the water with her magic to immobilize a Stille. They trap the Stille in ice, but it breaks free and speeds away with its supersonic speed. Frieren takes note of Kanne and Lawine's strong teamwork, and the group spends the rest of the day observing the habits of the bird.

Late at night, Kanne wakes up at the camp and notices Frieren is gone. As she searches for her, a Geisel attacks her and knocks away her staff. Suddenly, Frieren rescues her while also trying out her folk-magic spell to capture a bird. Kanne calms down after the surprise attack and walks back to the camp with Frieren, where they have a conversation about how Kanne looks back fondly towards Lawine's efforts to help her improve. Around the same time, Fern manages to catch a Stille and returns to her group members.

The next day, Frieren's group strategizes about how to catch a Stille with the information they gathered. Frieren proposes the idea of infuse bodies of water with mana, which should drive the thirsty Stille to a body of water without mana. Meanwhile, Fern's group searches for water after capturing their Stille. On their way, they are ambushed by the eighth party, consisting of Wirbel, Ehre, and Scharf. The groups prepare to face off in pairs, but they're suddenly interrupted by a large release of mana, caused by Lawine freezing the central lake over as part of Frieren's strategy.

Fern is matched up against Ehre, who uses her Doragate spell to change rocks into bullets, bombarding Fern with the projectiles. Ehre remarks that fighting against Fern's technique feels like fighting against her grandfather, and she notes how Fern only uses ordinary offensive and defensive magic. Fern sees Fern sees Ehre as the strongest of her group, while Ehre thinks Wirbel is. They engage in an exchange of attacks. Fern uses a barrage of offensive magic, which presses down Ehre's defense and ultimately defeats her. 

At the same time, Scharf and Land stand off at a clearing. Scharf uses his magic, Jubelade, to turn flower petals into metal, precisely slicing Land and rendering his right arm unusable. However, Land tells Scharf that he should be more observant of his opponents and that he is lacking in the fundamentals, such as mana detection. Scharf ignores his words and attacks, but Land appears behind him to take him out of action with a shock spell. Land reveals that Scharf did not fight him, but rather his clone.

Übel attacks Wirbel with her Reelseiden spell, which can slash through almost anything. Wirbel learns that the spell is short-ranged and exploits an opening to use his binding spell: Sorganeil, and he declares he can easily kill her now. With Übel restrained, he gives her the chance to walk off and leave the cage with the Stille behind. Übel concludes that the binding spell has a condition that requires the opponent be in full view for it to work. She throws the cage as a distraction into the air, making Wirbel look up and forcing him to release Sorganeil. Übel takes this opportunity to charge Wirbel, narrowly missing a slash to his eyes. He binds her again, and they have a conversation about how there are people who enjoy killing. Übel's personal belief is that the magic someone specializes in is connected to their life and character. She deduces Wirbel's binding spell gives him time to prepare to kill somebody, to which Wirbel agrees. As he charges a spell to kill Übel, Fern appears besides him and prompts him to stop. 

Wirbel asks if Fern killed Ehre, and she confirms that she did. He concludes that by losing one of their party members, his party has lost. Wirbel walks away and releases Übel from the binding. After Fern and Übel leave, he searches for Ehre and finds her out of mana at the location where she fought Fern. As Wirbel carries her on his back to find Scharf, they come across him incapacitated from Land's blow. Wirbel floats the mage with a spell and the three move on searching for a Stille. During a conversation about Wirbel's intention to become a first-class mage, the group manages to find and catch a Stille, which they hold on to until the end of the exam.

While the fourth and eighth parties fight, others try to melt the ice. Some groups around the lake reorientate their efforts to finding and catching a Stille in other places, as the lake with mana infusion would repel the birds. Denken, a member of the thirteenth party with Richter and Laufen, notices that Frieren's group must have a plan and proposes to take away their Stille. As Denken's group waits for Frieren to catch the bird, they come across another group that has fallen victim to the Geisel. When Laufen suggests taking the bodies out of the trees, Denken explains the monster's hunting trick: they lure prey with the corpses of their victims. The group then continues to lay in wait for Frieren's next move.

In the meantime, Frieren and Kanne infuse bodies of water with faint traces of mana to deter the Stille. They come together at a waterhole without mana infusion. Frieren suppresses her mana to a minimum while the other two members of her party hide nearby. As Frieren waits for a Stille, multiple beasts and monsters, including the Geisel, drink from the waterhole without paying attention to Frieren's presence. A Stille eventually lands on Frieren's shoulder, and she captures it with her folk magic. However, she releases mana in the process, which alerts Denken's team to her location. Laufen uses her high speed movement spell: Jilwer to close the distance and take away the cage with the Stille. Denken and Richter reveal themselves and prepare for battle, as the inexperienced Laufen has left mana traces that Frieren could follow to take the Stille back. 

Denken recognizes Frieren as the mage of the Hero Party. Frieren has noticed that her group was followed and is surprised that Denken challenges her. At first, Richter wants to kill Frieren's other two group members and secure the privilege granted by Serie, but Denken tells him to just hold them back. Richter begrudgingly complies and separates the two groups with his earth control spell: Bargland, raising himself, Kanne, and Lawine out of the ground and onto a mesa-like platform. As they prepare to fight, Denken tells Frieren that his reason for fighting isn't the privilege, but rather, the joy that comes with the pursuit of magic itself. Denken's words remind Frieren of her first meeting with Serie, and she vocalizes her agreement with Denken's perspective.

While Denken and Frieren fight, Richter shuts down Kanne and Lawine's attempts at defeating him, criticizing Lawine's freezing techniques that lack strength and Kanne's reliance on existing water. He gives them a lesson about the latest developments of magic used to fight, declaring that his earth manipulation, which makes use of overwhelming mass, can easily overcome the two mages' defenses. After Richter overpowers them, the three stop fighting as they wait for the conclusion of the fight between Frieren and Denken.

Frieren and Denken fight in the air until Denken realizes that he cannot sustain his defenses with his depleting mana. Denken lands and creates a fire tornado combining Waldgose, his tornado wind spell and Daosdorg, his wind-to-hellfire spell to attack Frieren, but she effortlessly resists with a sphere of defensive magic. Denken attempts to whittle Frieren with his Lights of Judgment spell: Catastravia down, but she unleashes a counterattack and closes the distance to blast him with offensive magic, exhausting his mana. First-class mages Genau and Sense witness their battle from afar, and Sense questions the strength of the barrier. She also reveals that someone had been analyzing the barrier, but Genau disregards her worries, as the barrier was enacted by Serie.

To get back the Stille, Frieren prompts Laufen to rescue Denken by acting like she would harm him. Laufen uses Jilwer to get Denken out of harm's way but is caught by Frieren. She then takes back the Stille and binds Laufen and Denken to a tree with magic. With the defeat of Denken, Richter takes action to kill Frieren's group members. However, Frieren finishes her analysis of the barrier and casts a spell to dispel it, which catches Serie's attention. Rain starts pouring inside the testing ground, and Kanne is free to manipulate the water. She casts her water manipulation magic, Reamstroha, which creates a giant sphere of water that she drops on Richter. The mass of her attack crushes Richter's defenses, and he is washed off the mesa. Frieren regroups with her teammates and congratulates them on defeating Richter. They continue defending their Stille until the end of the exam. Genau and Sense watch the barrier shatter, and Genau demands to know who Frieren is. Sense informs him that she is Frieren, the mage of the Hero Party and a holder of a Holy Emblem, signifying the elf's Great Mage status.

Richter is washed to Denken and Laufen, and Laufen frees herself and Denken from their restraints by cutting the tree they are tied to. Despite Denken and Richter being completely out of mana, Denken refuses to give up and suggests they search for other teams that are in similar situations. They come across a party that has lost a member, disqualifying them, but they still defend their Stille. Denken and Richter secure the bird with a fistfight and are able to keel it until the end of the exam. Meanwhile, Fern's group takes shelter from the rain in a cave. Fern and Übel talk about spells, and Land urges Fern not to give away all her abilities since they could end up as enemies at a later stage. They stay until the evening and pass the exam.

In the evening, Genau declares the exam is over. Out of the original 57 examinees, 18 manage to pass the first stage of the exam.

## [ARCS] Episode 1
**The Journey's End** ｢冒 (ぼう) 険 (けん) の終 (お) わり, *Bōken no owari*?｣ is the first episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series. It is the first part of the initial two-hour premier episode, released on September 29, 2023.

## Synopsis]

The world celebrates the Demon King's defeat at the hands of the Hero and his companions. Now that their great adventure is over, what will Frieren the mage do next? 

## Plot]

The Hero Party, consisting of Frieren the Mage and her companions Himmel the Hero, Heiter the Priest, and Eisen the Warrior. They return to the Royal Capital after triumphantly defeating the Demon King. On their way, Himmel suggests that despite their achievements, they still need to seek employment upon their arrival and continue forward with their lives. He tells Frieren that the life ahead of her will be much longer than theirs, which she nonchalantly agrees with. The heroes reach the city amidst a large celebration in their honor and receive recognition from the King.

That night, they enjoy a festival held by the townsfolk, during which Himmel informs the others that the King intends to erect statues of them in the plaza. The Hero Party reminisce on their journey and the humorous moments that had occurred throughout it, finding it hard to believe that it has come to an end after ten years. Himmel expresses his gratitude towards his companions for the time he spent and the memories he made on the journey with them. Frieren points out that they spent a mere ten years together, surprising Himmel. They all look up into the sky to witness the Era Meteors, an event that occurs only once every fifty years, and Himmel decides to label it as the start of an era of peace. Frieren proposes that she brings the party to a better location for viewing the meteors the next time they occur, and Himmel laughs and accepts the offer.

The next day, Himmel and the others accompany Frieren to a bridge to bid her farewell. She informs them that she plans on traveling through the Central Lands for the next century and collect spells, though she may visit them every now and then. As she departs, Himmel wonders about the life she will lead, and Heiter refers to how time passes differently for her.

Frieren immerses in various experiences and activities during her solo journey for the next fifty years. She visits a shop in an attempt to obtain a Shadow Dragon's Horn, but the shop owner informs her that the shop does not have one. Frieren remembers that the Hero Party found a horn during their exploration of the Demon King's castle and she had left it with Himmel for safekeeping. With the next occurrence of the Era Meteors approaching, Frieren decides to head back to the Royal Capital and retrieve it from him upon their reunion.

Upon returning to the city, Frieren is shocked by how much it has changed. When Himmel reunites with her, she is equally surprised by how much he has aged. Himmel reminds the elf Frieren that fifty years have passed, though he remarks that she still looks the same. He presents the shadow dragon's horn to Frieren, stating that he had always intended to return it to her someday. She and Himmel then prepare for the upcoming Era Meteors at Himmel's home.

The two reunite with Heiter, who is now a bishop in the Holy City, and Eisen, and Frieren notices that while Heiter has also aged considerably, Eisen's appearance remains relatively unchanged due to his longer dwarven lifespan. Frieren informs them that it will take a week to reach the location with a better view of the Era Meteors, which disappoints Himmel. As they adventure to the location, Himmel reflects on their memories and how much he had missed traveling with his comrades. The reunited party arrives at a giant lake underneath a clear sky, and as they once again watch the Era Meteors, Himmel expresses gratitude to Frieren for providing him with a wonderful final adventure.

Shortly after, Himmel passes away, and the remaining members of the Hero Party attend his funeral. As the bishop, Heiter holds his funeral. In his coffin, Himmel is surrounded by flowers and dressed in his hero's attire with his sword. During the procession, Heiter mentions to Frieren and Eisen that Himmel was happy. Numerous civilians gather to pay their respects, and Frieren overhears people gossiping about her apparent lack of emotion at the passing of one of her companions. Heiter defends Frieren, reminding them that he and Eisen were also Himmel's allies and yet, they are not expressing sadness. As Himmel is buried, Frieren reminisces about the time she spent with him. Despite only traveling with him, merely for ten years, Frieren begins to cry, regretting not getting to know Himmel better. Heiter and Eisen offer her comfort.

After the funeral, Frieren and Eisen bid farewell to Heiter, who is returning to the Holy City. Before leaving, Heiter jokes about the possibility of this event being the last time he will see them, prompting Frieren to question if he is unafraid of passing away. Heiter reminds Frieren that they are legendary heroes and believes they will lead a good life in Heaven after death. After Heiter departs, Frieren confides in Eisen that she plans to learn more about humans and asks if he can accompany her. He reminds her that he is too old and his age will be a hindrance in combat, however, he reassures her that his life has slowed down past his prime. They bid farewell to each other and go their separate ways.

Twenty years after Himmel's death, Frieren finds herself lost in the woods at the outskirts of the Holy City in the Central Lands. A young girl discovers Frieren and guides her to Heiter's residence, where Frieren is astonished to discover that Heiter is still alive. Heiter introduces the girl as Fern and reveals that she is a war orphan from the Southern Lands. Frieren explains that she had been traveling the continent to learn about humans but stopped by to repay her debt to Heiter before his death. Heiter asks if Frieren could mentor Fern as an apprentice given that Fern shows potential as a mage, but Frieren declines, fearing that Fern's inexperience would hinder her. Additionally, she points out that apprentice mages frequently die in battle, and she cannot allow for that to happen to Fern.

Heiter acknowledges Frieren's decision and asks if she can instead decipher a grimoire depicting immortality and resurrection that was written by Ewig the Sage. Frieren accepts his request and tells him she can finish deciphering the grimoire in five to six years, though she wonders why he is interested in the topic despite having been unafraid of death twenty years ago. He jokingly tells her that the holy texts say to live healthy lives, and he now admits that he now fears death the more he approaches it and simply wishes for more time. He asks Frieren to teach Fern magic in her spare time, and Frieren concedes.

Frieren goes to look for Fern and finds her by a cliff overlooking a ravine. She tells the young girl that she had trouble looking for her, but Fern points out that being difficult to find is a good thing. Frieren agrees and wonders to herself how Fern had established a high level of mana control at such a young age. Fern informs Frieren that Heiter mentioned she would be close to becoming a proper mage when she could blast a large rock at the opposite end of the ravine. As Frieren endorses the method, Fern immediately casts a beam of offensive magic that nearly hits the rock. She explains to Frieren that her magic dissipates before making contact and asks how she should train it. Before Frieren gives her advice, she asks if Fern enjoys magic, and Fern admits that she somewhat likes it. Frieren notes they are alike in that sense.

## [ARCS] Episode 2
**It Didn't Have to Be Magic...** ｢別 (べつ) に魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) じゃなくたって…, *Betsu ni mahō ja nakutatte…*?｣ is the second episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series. It is the second part of the initial two-hour premier episode, released on September 29, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Frieren instructs Fern in the use of magic while deciphering a grimoire for Heiter. 

## Plot]

Frieren begins to teach Fern the basics of long-range magic, emphasizing that Fern's mana output and strength will require years of training to master. However, her control over mana, an aspect many mages struggle with, is very high. Over the next four years, Frieren continues to decipher the grimoire while Fern diligently trains under the elf's tutelage and alone in the woods.

When asked about the child's progress by Heiter, Frieren explains that she has learned more than most people would in a decade and that she is studying a little too hard. Suddenly, Heiter collapses, and he later becomes bedridden. Heiter remarks that it is miracle that he had been mobile for so long and Frieren ensures him that she will decipher the grimoire quickly. The elf then tells Fern to pause her training on the cliff to stay by Heiter's side, but Fern rejects this notion, saying that she has to be able to hit the rock with her magic before the priest's death.

A backstory shows that a younger Fern, who had lost her parents and home, was about to jump off a cliff in the aftermath of a war before being stopped by an aged Heiter, who says that it would be a waste for her to die. He explains that he once lost an old friend of his who never abandoned anyone who was in need, supposing that if he were to stay alive, more people would've been saved by his hands compared to the priest's. Heiter had planned to lived his life quietly, but came to the realization that everything that he learned, including precious memories, from his friend would go to waste that way. Likewise for Fern, he believes that the child holds precious memories that should not go wasted.

Having been saved by Heiter, Fern believes that the best way to repay him is to learn any skill that would help her survive so that he could remain glad that she was saved and will manage to be safe on her own. Convinced by the child's convictions, Frieren allows her to continue training as she continues to decipher the grimoire that could possibly save Heiter.

Eventually, Fern is finally able to achieve her goal of hitting the rock with her offensive magic spell while Frieren finishes deciphering the grimoire, which she concludes does not contain any spells related to revival or immortality. This revelation, however, does not surprise Heiter, who supposes that Ewig the Sage would have used the spell himself if it was true. With Frieren's approval of Fern being a proper mage, Heiter reveals that his main objective all along was to have Fern learn enough that she would not be a hindrance to Frieren as the elf's traveling apprentice. 

Heiter requests that the two leave the same night before his death so that Fern does not lose anyone anymore, but an emotional Frieren rejects this and tells Heiter to give the child a proper farewell and to make as many memories as possible. When asked why he saved Fern, Heiter gives the reasoning that Himmel the Hero would have done the same thing. Later, Frieren climbs the same cliff where she met Fern to witness the fruits of the child's training. 

 
Heiter's death eventually arrives as Fern expresses gratitude to Frieren for allowing her to repay the priest as the elf pours two full bottles of alcohol over his tombstone. The two depart from Strahl and finally set off on their journey.

Over the next few years, Frieren and Fern perform odd and simple jobs in exchange for magic spells. They eventually arrive at the Turk Region. The duo use their magic to harvest pumpkins. The payment for helping to harvest was given by the pumpkin farmer in the form of a spell that makes hot tea. Fern does not see the appeal in collecting spells for removing rust of bronze statue or a spell turning sweet grapes sour. Fern believes that the two share slightly different views on magic, but Frieren insists that they are both the same in loving magic. Later on, they come upon a herbalist who requests the two for help in cleaning the statue of Himmel, who had saved her life in the past, in exchange for information about the local flora. The statue is then cleaned by them, however, not before Frieren reminisces about how long it took for the hero to settle on a pose for the statue.

The herbalist plans to add some flowers to give the statue more color, but before Frieren casts a flower bed-making spell, she remembers that Himmel used to love blue-moon weed flowers, though she has never seen them herself. The herbalist claims that it has been decades since the flowers have been spotted, but this does not stop Frieren from searching for them. Before leaving, Frieren spots Fern hiding seed rats in her robe as the latter claims that she will release them in the forest.

Six months pass into Frieren's search for the flowers, and Fern is discouraged to learn that the elf does not plan on stopping anytime soon. An impatient Fern vents to the herbalist about how Frieren should not be spending her time searching for something that doesn't exist. In response to this, the herbalist hands Fern a bag of seeds of a related species and tells Fern to convey her feelings to the elf as she must see things very differently to humans.

As Fern expresses her feelings to Frieren, the latter understands that she is no longer on her own time and claims that the search will end soon. Fern is displeased to hear "soon", but before she can continue the conversation, the two spot a seed rat that takes the bag of seeds and they proceed to follow it. Fern asks Frieren why she collects spells, and although it may seem more than that, Frieren insists that it was just a hobby that an idiot complimented. Frieren has a flashback to said idiot where she used the spell to produce a field of flowers. All members of the Hero Party enjoyed the moment.

The two eventually spot a tower the seed rat wandered to. Frieren lectures her apprentice that seed rats would bury and often forget about things they collect. Frieren flies towards the top of the tower as a flashback occurs in which the previous is continued and Himmel is seen wishing to view the blue-moon weed flowers with Frieren. The top of the tower is revealed to be full of said flowers as Fern soon follows Frieren from behind. Fern continues to not understand why Frieren loves magic, but the latter insists that she does understand as she chose to learn magic above all else.

Himmel's statue is finally decorated with a bed of blue-moon weed flowers to the satisfaction of the herbalist. Before Frieren and Fern leave, Frieren place a wreath of flowers on top of Himmel's head as she remembers the wreaths on her comrade's heads.

- The home of the herbalist is located in the middle of the village in the manga, whereas in the anime, it is located within a remote area in the woods.

- While Frieren talks to Fern about searching for the blue-moon weed, she stares at a leaf and twirls it in her hand in the anime. In the manga, a visual of a blue-moon weed flower is used instead.

- Frieren uses her spell to make a field of flowers for the Hero Party in a flashback, but instead of casting it in an open space like she does in the manga, the anime shows her casting it outside the ruins of a church with a statue of the Goddess of Creation.

**Killing Magic** ｢人 (ひと) を殺 (ころ) す魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) , *Hito o korosu mahō*?｣ is the third episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series. It is the third part of the initial two-hour premier episode, released on September 29, 2023.

## Synopsis]

While retracing the path she took on her adventure with her former traveling companions, Frieren confronts an old enemy. 

## Plot]

Twenty-seven years after Himmel the Hero's passing, Frieren and Fern find themselves in the trade city of Warm in the Central Lands. As they stroll through the city, Frieren instructs Fern to split up and restock their travel supplies. Fern, realizing most responsibilities fall on her, asks about Frieren's shopping plans. Frieren pauses before responding that she plans on buying herbs and the likes. Reading Frieren's suspicious expression, Fern recalls instances when Frieren purchased a monster's skull, a cloth-dissolving potion that she was told to return, and a book on magical history. Fern hesitates to deem the last item unnecessary.

As Frieren takes a different path at a fork, Fern decides to tail her, mindful of their travel expenses. Observing Frieren at an accessory shop, Fern speculates that, despite her usual neglect of hair care, Frieren might have an interest in fashion. Fern looks at an incredibly perplexed Frieren from behind as she remarks that her master has never made such a face before. After a long time which Fern spent petting a cat, Frieren finally buys an accessory and Fern supposes that one accessory would not be too bad.

As Fern decides to start shopping, she overhears Frieren asking about good desserts in town, which Fern finds unfair, given her own sweets deprivation for months. Frieren is directed to a dubious tavern, where she inquires about desserts, garnering responses from intimidating, but passionate adventurers. As Frieren bids farewell, Fern realizes she's heading back to the inn rather than a dessert shop, and that Fern has not done any shopping yet. 

Later at the inn, Frieren tells Fern she's late, and Fern apologizes. As Fern sets down her purchased items, Frieren suggests getting something sweet to eat and awkwardly exits the room.

Frieren and Fern arrive at the recommended place, and Frieren admires the view of the sun and the city, appreciating the adventurers' suggestion. Fern then apologizes to Frieren for doubting her, although Frieren has no idea what she is talking about. Frieren encourages Fern to choose whatever she likes and reveals her secret savings to cover the expenses. When Frieren wonders what she herself will have, Fern surprises her by correctly guessing that she feels like eating Merkur pudding.

In a flashback, the Hero Party dined together, and Himmel accurately guessed that Frieren desired Merkur pudding. Curious, Frieren questioned how he knew, and Himmel attributed it to years of traveling together. Frieren admitted knowing nothing about the rest of the party, prompting Himmel to promise to share more about himself. He revealed his favorite meal was a Ruf-omelette, while Eisen mentioned his preference for sour grapes. Before Heiter could share his choice, Frieren interjected, stating she already knew he liked alcohol. Eisen tells Heiter not to blush, and Himmel noted it was concerning that Frieren only remembered that detail.

The flashback ends, and Frieren apologizes to Fern for not knowing her preferences. Frieren then presents Fern with a box, and Fern realizes it's her birthday. Opening the box, she finds a beautifully crafted hair ornament with a butterfly motif. Grateful, Fern thanks Frieren, appreciating the thoughtful gift. Despite Frieren's apparent cluelessness, Fern affectionately remarks on Frieren's attempts to understand her, finding joy in the effort, even if Frieren doesn't fully grasp human emotions.

The following morning, Frieren and Fern resume their journey, with Fern proudly wearing her new hair ornament. As they walk along a road, Fern questions the purpose of their journey. Frieren responds that it's primarily to fulfill her desire to collect spells, although she also expresses a desire to retrace the adventure she had with Himmel and the Hero Party before the signs of their existence vanish. Fern acknowledges the importance of this to Frieren, but Frieren admits she's not entirely sure and intends to discover more about it as they progress.

As the two walk, Frieren observes that Fern has grown taller again. Fern mentions that she is now sixteen, old enough to be an older sister. Frieren glances at Fern’s chest and notes that it's strange Fern has developed more despite sharing the same diet.

Later, Frieren and Fern are training in the Größe Forest. Frieren casts a spell at Fern, who promptly blocks it with a defensive spell which shields her front. Frieren notes Fern's improvement but challenges her further with a spell that bends through her defenses and dissipates before hitting Fern. In surprise, the young mage drops to her knees. Frieren emphasizes the importance of addressing defensive gaps in a real battle. The training intensifies as Frieren launches multiple spells, prompting Fern to correctly respond with an omnidirectional-shielding spherical defensive spell as Frieren continues with more spells. Fern becomes fatigued, leading Frieren to conclude the training.

As they walk, Frieren explains to Fern that the defensive spell is powerful but depletes mana rapidly. Expanding it continuously would exhaust one's mana supply within seconds. Fern deduces that casting smaller spells at the moment of impact for each spell is a more efficient strategy, and Frieren confirms. Fern notes that they have only been training in defensive magic and Frieren replies it is because it is directly linked to their survival. Fern agrees, noting how strange it is how powerful the defensive spells are. 

Frieren tugs Fern’s arm as she realizes that Fern has not read the magical history book that was given to her, asserting the importance of theory in magic in relation to practice. Frieren sighs and supposes that she may have to read it to Fern at bedtime as Fern responds that she will read it herself as she is not a child. 

Frieren and Fern reach a village, and Fern inquires about collecting unusual spells. Frieren dismisses the idea, revealing there's something different this time. Frieren approaches the villagers with a question, and one of them recognizes her features. Curious, Frieren asks how he knew, and the villager leads her to the location where Qual was sealed.

As they walk, Fern questions Qual's identity, and the villager recounts that he is the Elder Sage of Corruption, responsible for terrible atrocities eighty years ago before being sealed by Himmel the Hero and his party. Frieren notes that the seal is about to break, expressing surprise at how the villager knows as she has not told anyone. The villager explains that Himmel visited the village annually until thirty years ago to check on the seal. Frieren notes Himmel's virtue, and the villager reveals that Himmel often criticized Frieren, calling her heartless and cold for neglecting to check on the demon. Frieren apologizes, but the villager continues, stating that Himmel knew Frieren wouldn't forsake the village and would return when the seal was about to break.

The three arrive at the sealing site that contains a towering Qual. Frieren observes the unstable seal and tells the villager that she will dispel the seal tomorrow and kill Qual. 

Later that night, Fern questions Frieren about whether she was the one to seal Qual and the reasons behind it. Frieren discloses that Qual was sealed due to his exceptional power. She reminisces about a memory where the Hero Party faced near defeat against Qual, an outstanding mage credited with creating Zoltraak, the first piercing magic in history. Zoltraak had the unique ability to penetrate defensive spells and magic-infused armor, directly harming the body. Frieren elaborates that in this region, 40% of adventurers and 70% of mages fell victim to Zoltraak's deadly capabilities.

Fern comments on the overwhelming power of Zoltraak, and Frieren agrees, adding that it was also the reason for Qual's downfall. Intrigued, Fern asks for clarification, but Frieren notes once again that Fern has not read the magical history book. Frieren suggests reading it to Fern, but Fern expresses her willingness to start reading immediately. Frieren, however, advises her to get some rest, assuring her that she will understand more the next day.

The next day, Frieren directs Fern to stand guard as she initiates the process of undoing Qual's seal. Qual awakens and greets Frieren, inquiring about the elapsed time. Frieren casually mentions that it's been eighty years from their perspective. Qual then questions the fate of the Demon King, and Frieren promptly discloses that the Demon King has been killed. Qual decides to avenge the Demon King and begins casting Zoltraak. Frieren instructs Fern to cast a defensive spell, and to Qual's surprise, Fern successfully blocks his spell, prompting him to acknowledge the potency of the defensive magic.

Confused, Fern questions the nature of Qual's seemingly ordinary offensive spell. Frieren reveals it to be Zoltraak, a potent spell that mages across the lands studied, analyzed and integrated into human magic, alongside new defensive spells, within a few years. She explains that advancements in magic resistance of equipment have also transformed Zoltraak from a lethal force into a mere ordinary offensive spell, highlighting how long eighty years is for humans. 

Frieren offers Qual a peaceful death if he cooperates, but undeterred, Qual instead casts defensive magic and observes how it attunes to and disperses offensive spells, realizing its significant mana consumption. He retaliates with a barrage of Zoltraak spells. Frieren instructs Fern to handle defense and steps back to cast her own spell. As Qual's spells breach Fern's defenses, he switches to a powerful frontal attack. Fern successfully responds with a frontal defensive spell. Qual notices Frieren above, curious about Frieren's ability to use flying magic, and attempts to attack her. Frieren counters with Zoltraak, destroying most of Qual's torso. In his fading moments, Qual laments the use of his own spell against him. With the battle over, Frieren lands in front of an exhausted Fern.

Later in the village, Fern is seen reading the magical history book while waiting for Frieren, who is being thanked by the villagers. The villager who led them to Qual remarks that they can finally live in peace. Frieren recognizes the villager as the brat who once flipped her skirt up from his straw hat.

A short flashback reveals the young villager flipping Frieren’s skirt up. Himmel, held back by Heiter, was outraged, asserting that he wanted to see the same thing for the longest time. As the kid runs around, Eisen told Himmel not to harm the kid, and Heiter offered to show his underwear instead, which disgusted Frieren.

As the flashback ends, Frieren notes the villager's survival, and he credits her for extending his life, thanking her for believing in Himmel's words. As Frieren and Fern depart on a carriage, Fern mentions the villagers' gratitude. Frieren clarifies that it's not directed at her but rather their belief in Himmel. Though Fern doesn’t understand, she acknowledges Himmel's belief in Frieren. Frieren smiles, patting Fern's head, and when asked about it, she dismisses it as nothing. Together, they gaze at the sky as the carriage moves away.

## [ARCS] Episode 4
**The Land Where Souls Rest** ｢魂 (たましい) の眠 (ねむ) る地 (ち) , *Tamashii no nemuru chi*?｣ is the fourth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series. It is the fourth and final part of the initial two-hour premier episode, released on September 29, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Frieren and Fern pay a visit to Eisen, who requests their help in finding the notes of Flamme the Legendary Mage.

## Plot]

27 years after Hero Himmel's passing, Frieren and Fern find themselves at the Granz Channel in the Central Lands. Guided by an elderly villager, they make their way to a neglected beach, a notorious area known for its difficulty to navigate, resulting in numerous shipwrecks over the years. The villager explains that the shore has remained unkempt due to the lack of villagers to assist with the cleanup efforts.

The villager offers Frieren a grimoire, claiming it was authored by the Great Mage Flamme. Frieren, despite recognizing it as a fake, decides to accept the villager's cleanup request. As the villager leaves, Fern questions the authenticity of the grimoire. Frieren acknowledges Fern's dedication to her studies and clarifies that books attributed to Flamme are always false. When asked why she took the request, knowing it was a fake, Frieren explains that she is simply helping someone in need, and partly doing it for her own reasons. Fern notes that it seems they will be staying in the village for a while.

Three months have passed, and winter has set in. Fern, now accustomed to village life, starts her day by buying bread in the morning before heading to the Inn. There, she finds Frieren still asleep, surrounded by a disordered pile of books on the floor, despite Fern having tidied up the day before. Urging Frieren to wake up, Fern proceeds to brush her hair, clean her after breakfast, and help her get dressed. As Frieren struggles with sleepiness, Fern ends up dragging her along to complete the shore cleanup. Working in the freezing cold, Fern questions Frieren's untidiness, expressing how she often has to wake her up, provide breakfast, and assist with dressing, essentially playing the role of Frieren's mother. Frieren responds by claiming she can manage those tasks on her own but concedes that she might end up waking up at noon if left to her own devices. Fern asserts that she has already given up hope in Frieren. When asked about how she travelled with the Hero Party, Frieren admits to frequently oversleeping but only facing consequences once. Fern comments on the party's apparent tolerance, and Frieren agrees, adding that, however, Heiter occasionally clicked his tongue at her before being stopped by Eisen and Himmel. Fern realizes that the party must have often been upset with her after all.

Frieren and Fern complete their daily cleanup, burning the collected debris. Frieren informs the elderly villager that they have a third left, anticipating finishing in time for the New Year's Festival. The villager expresses hope that Frieren will watch the sunrise this time. The next day, Fern inquires about the festival's connection to the cleanup, and Frieren explains the village tradition of watching the sunrise due to the beautiful light reflecting off the shore. When asked if she has seen it before, Frieren questions Fern's belief in her ability to wake up early.

A montage follows, showcasing Frieren and Fern's cleanup process and life in the village. The montage concludes on the day before the festival, with the successful completion of the beach cleanup. The villager thanks Frieren and Fern, inviting Frieren to join the village for the festival. Frieren agrees, prompting Fern to question her sanity, given the need to wake up before sunrise. Frieren suggests staying up all night, and when Fern asks if she's desperate to see the sunrise, Frieren responds that her lack of interest is precisely why she wants to see it, leaving Fern confused.

Late at night, Frieren reads a grimoire while Fern sleeps. Frieren reminisces about a past New Year's Festival with the Hero's Party. Himmel questions Frieren's absence, pointing out Heiter's shock that left him bedridden, but Eisen mentions that he simply drank too much. Frieren dismisses Himmel's question, stating that everyone else attended. Himmel expresses a desire for Frieren to enjoy the experience with them, insisting she would have liked it because of who she is, despite Frieren's doubts. As the memory fades, Frieren dozes off, and Fern wakes up.

Fern panics and tries to wake Frieren to avoid being late for the festival. In her sleep, Frieren calls Fern her mother before they both prepare to go out. As Fern wonders why she even bothers, Frieren, still half-asleep, thanks Fern for her help, causing her to smile.

Later, Frieren and Fern observe the sunrise. Frieren privately reflects that, despite its beauty, it was not worth waking up for, supposing that Himmel didn't understand her well after all. Intent on going home, Frieren is surprised when she looks at Fern. Fern comments on the sunrise's beauty, while Frieren dismisses it as a normal sunrise. Despite this, Fern notes that Frieren seems to be enjoying herself. Frieren explains that it's simply because Fern is smiling. Frieren admits that she would have never been able to observe the sunrise alone as the two continue to look at the sunrise.

In a flashback, the Hero's Party is depicted standing before two simple graves. Heiter asks Eisen if the graves belong to his family, and Eisen responds that they are from a time long ago when demons attacked his village. Heiter smiles and begins to pray, expressing his belief that people go to Heaven when they die. Eisen expresses doubt, revealing that he believes people turn to nothingness as they die. Frieren interjects, mentioning that until a thousand years ago, the belief in an afterlife wasn't common, and Dwarves, like Eisen, valued tradition. Frieren herself is uncertain about the afterlife, as no current magic can observe the souls of the dead to disprove or prove the existence of an afterlife. Himmel comments that it doesn't really matter, and Heiter agrees. Heiter suggests that even if the afterlife doesn't exist, it is still better to believe that people go to Heaven after trying their best in life. The Hero's Party, in agreement with Heiter's perspective, begins to pray.

28 years after the death of Hero Himmel, Frieren and Fern meet with Eisen in the Bredt region, in the Central Lands. Frieren calls out to a praying Eisen saying that she has come to hang out. Eisen asserts that Frieren is not acting like it has been thirty years. Frieren responds that a mere thirty years is nothing as Eisen scoffs and agrees.

At Eisen's home, he admits surprise to find Frieren accompanied by an apprentice. Frieren inquires if there's anything Eisen needs assistance with. Eisen discloses that he's aware Frieren asked the same question to Heiter and asserts that he is not close to his deathbed just yet. Frieren questions how he knows, prompting Eisen to reveal he often exchanged letters with Heiter.

Eisen then guides Frieren and Fern to the Voll Basin, a place that is nostalgic to Frieren, having visited it long ago. Whispering to Eisen, Fern speculates that it must have been in prehistoric times. Frieren overhears and remarks that even she isn't that old. Turning to the purpose of their visit, Eisen reveals that he is looking for notes authored by the Great Mage Flamme. Frieren accepts Eisen's request but asks whether Eisen is aware that a significant portion of Flamme's writings are fakes.

Eisen reveals that he has a lead on an authentic note, courtesy of Heiter's research from Holy City records that Flamme's notes are likely hidden in the Voll Basin. Eisen surmises that Frieren might have known about it, leading to her surprised reaction at the depth of Heiter's research. Frieren concedes, suggesting they begin the search by locating a giant tree.

Eisen, surveying the densely wooded surroundings, remarks on the abundance of trees in the area. In response, he casually notes that time is on Frieren's side, prompting Fern to start pouting. Frieren tells Eisen that she will try to finish as soon as possible as Fern would not enjoy her taking too long as Fern instructs the two to begin their search as efficiently as possible. Eisen notes that Frieren now seems mindful of others' time, a change from her previous indifference. Frieren responds that it's only because Fern can be intimidating when upset.
,

A montage ensues as the trio embarks on their search throughout Voll Basin. Later, Fern informs Frieren that she has spotted a tree growing over some ruins. As they approach the location, Frieren queries Eisen about his decision to seek Flamme's notes. Eisen responds that he simply felt sorry for Frieren and Himmel, recalling the moment when Frieren began regretting not getting to know Himmel. Eisen advises Frieren to share these sentiments directly with Himmel.

Eisen points out that Flamme's writings contain descriptions of her conversing with the dead. However, Frieren dismisses it as a fairy tale, asserting that she doesn't want to meet Himmel at the moment. Eisen inquires if Frieren doesn't wish to learn more about Himmel, disclosing that he had discussed it with Heiter. Both were certain that Frieren harbored regrets and wanted to assist her.

Eventually, the trio arrives at a giant tree and ruins that Fern observes are protected by a powerful barrier. As Fern touches the tree, Frieren reflects that even after a thousand years, her master still has her dancing in the palm of her hand.

In a flashback, Frieren expresses doubt about how a sapling will stand guard at a certain location. Frieren's master disagrees and casts magic over the sapling, declaring that it will protect the area a thousand years from now. Frieren remarks that her master would be long dead by then, but her master responds that Frieren will not. Frieren's master asserts that Frieren will make a terrible mistake and will wish she had gotten to know people better. Frieren's master tells her to return to this place when that time comes, identifying herself as the Great Mage Flamme who will be the one to help Frieren.

In the present day, Frieren's touch prompts Flamme's thousand year old tree to open, revealing a ruin containing a book. Frieren begins reading through the book, confirming its authenticity to Fern. Curious, Fern asks how Frieren is so sure, and Eisen discloses that Frieren was Flamme's best student. Responding to this revelation, Fern wonders if Frieren truly isn't from prehistoric times, as Flamme is depicted as an ancient hero in history. Eisen then asks Frieren if the book contains information on communicating with the dead. Frieren confirms, mentioning that the book was already opened to a page about that topic, making her wonder if Flamme foresaw her return a thousand years prior.

Frieren reads the page aloud, revealing Flamme's account of traveling to a place called Heaven or Aureole, the land where souls rest. There, Flamme communicated with friends who once fought alongside her. Fern asks once again if it's true, and Frieren is uncertain due to Flamme's irresponsible nature. However, Eisen asserts that Heaven exists, deeming it more convenient that way. Aureole is revealed to be located in Ende, where the Demon King's Castle resides. Eisen instructs Frieren to go to Aureole and speak with Himmel, as part of his request. Frieren accepts as she had no specific destination in mind anyway, though she expresses reluctance due to the cold around the Demon King's Castle.

Later, in a carriage, Frieren sleeps and complains about not wanting to go due to the cold. Fern questions Eisen about the castle's temperature, and he explains it is situated in the northernmost end of the continent, where the Hero Party faced numerous challenges.

Feeling the carriage situation is awkward, Fern contemplates waking Frieren, but Frieren continues to sleep on Fern's lap. Eisen asks if Frieren is a good master. Fern, uncertain, notes that Frieren often drags her around in search of magic and has shown interest in learning about Himmel and his companions. However, Fern doubts this interest applies to her personally, as Frieren took her as an apprentice only as a promise to Heiter. Despite Frieren's apparent disinterest, Fern finds it peculiar that Frieren started giving her birthday presents when they began traveling together, expressing her curiosity about Frieren's thoughts.

Eisen recalls a memory in the Royal Capital where the Hero Party watched the Era Meteors. Himmel asks Frieren if she will stay in the Capital, and she responds that she will continue traveling alone. Eisen suggests taking on an apprentice, but Frieren dismisses it as a waste of time, arguing that any apprentice would die relatively quickly even with her teachings. Eisen disagrees, stating that is not what relationships are like. Frieren maintains her stance, emphasizing that her time with the Hero Party is less than one-hundredth of her life, and supposes that Eisen should understand too. Wanting to lighten the atmosphere, Heiter encourages the rest of the party to start drinking, as it is a celebratory day, with Himmel teasing Heiter for wanting an excuse to drink.

As the memory ends, Eisen tells Fern that Frieren is a good master, prompting Fern to smile and agree as Frieren also smiles in her sleep.

Later at Eisen's home, Frieren asks Eisen if he really does not plan on coming along. Eisen confirms, reaffirming that he would only get in the way. Frieren acknowledges this and confirms to Eisen that she knows the way to Ende. As Frieren and Fern begin to take their leave, Eisen apologizes to Fern for it will be a long journey as it took the Hero Party ten years. Fern is surprised, but understands that they will be retracing the steps of Himmel and his party.

Frieren looks up as she remembers the party finally arriving at the Demon King's Castle, before turning around. Frieren tells Fern that it will be a mere ten years of adventure.

## [ARCS] Episode 5
**Phantoms of the Dead** ｢死 (し) 者 (しゃ) の幻 (げん) 影 (えい) , *Shisha no gen'ei*?｣ is the fifth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on October 6, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Frieren and Fern investigate ghost sightings at a village where people have started going missing.

## Plot]

At Eisen's home, Eisen mentions that the mere 10-year journey will be one one-hundredth of Frieren's life as he reminds her of the interaction they had when the party first observed the Era Meteors together. Eisen smiles, finding it funny how a mere one one-hundredth of Frieren's life has changed her as memories of the past to the present begin to flash in Frieren's mind. Frieren and Eisen bid farewell to each other as Frieren and Fern leave. As the two walk, Fern tells Frieren that her time with Frieren so far has taken up half her life. Frieren smiles and tells her that it will be greater than that from now on.

Fern has a dream of a memory where Heiter tells her to be a good girl and to abide by Frieren's words, adding that he will haunt her after he is dead if she doesn't. The young Fern smiles and asks if Heiter will visit her if she becomes a bad girl. Heiter pats Fern's head, remarking on how cunning she has grown before supposing that he may visit her sometime if she is a good girl. Fern is then awoken from her dream as Frieren tells her that they are about to reach a village.

28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero, Frieren and Fern are in the Wille region of the Central Lands. After buying supplies at a small town, Frieren and Fern are approached by a marketeer lady who warns the two not to head to the mountain pass as many people have gone missing due to a supposed ghost. When Frieren inquires for more information, she prompts to ask those who have seen the ghost. The two begin to ask various villagers about their encounters.

Later in the evening, Fern summarizes that people saw ghosts of their dead family and acquaintances just as they appeared in life, with some even reporting that the ghosts spoke to them. Frieren deduces this isn't the work of the undead but of a different monster, as the undead are reanimated corpses and would not resemble the living. Understanding the danger, Frieren suggests avoiding the village and leaving early the next morning. Fern insists on helping the villagers, prompting Frieren to liken her to Himmel and the others. Fern jokes that she is a "good girl" unlike Frieren. Frieren smiles, agreeing to help if Fern is determined, noting they'll pass through the mountain regardless.

The next day, Fern and Frieren reach the area where the villagers are reported to have gone missing. The two look around and find various clues and traces of magic, which Fern correctly deduces as illusion magic. Fern notes that she read about a monster that uses illusions to lure prey in a magical ecology book, which Frieren identifies as the Einsam, a monster that exclusively consumes humans by luring them with phantoms of the dead dear to them. Frieren adds that Einsam's illusions aren't a threat to mages, as they can be dispersed with high-density mana like basic offensive magic. Frieren asks Fern if she is capable of shooting the phantoms, to which Fern confirms, aware of their true nature. Frieren shares her own experience of having to dispel her master's phantom, admitting she has become accustomed to it despite the discomfort it brings.

As they venture deeper into the woods, Fern notices the mist thickening. Frieren warns her they're nearing the source and urges her not to hesitate in dispelling any phantoms. Suddenly, Fern hears Heiter's voice and turns to see his phantom, momentarily startled. Despite preparing to fire, Fern hesitates when the phantom compliments her for being good. As the phantom speaks, Fern realizes the cruelty of manipulating her cherished memories.

Frieren realizes that Fern is unable to hear her and summons her staff before a phantom of Himmel appears behind Frieren, despite Frieren assuming it would be Flamme again. Frieren wonders if she has changed as the phantom of Himmel smiles and tells her to shoot him. Frieren remarks that Himmel would say exactly that as she fires Zoltraak at the phantom. The blast clears the mist, revealing Einsam looming above Heiter's phantom. Fern swiftly destroys the monster, now visible in the clearing.

Fern remarks that the Heiter that appeared was a fake. As the two continue walking, Frieren tells Fern that they will go to see the real Heiter as they are headed to Aureole.

Later, Frieren and Fern are in the Riegel Canyon. The two hide in a bush, observing a sleeping Solar Dragon. Fern notes she has never seen a dragon before. Frieren points to a grimoire in the dragon's nest, identifying it as the one she seeks. Fern asks about the grimoire. Frieren explains dragons use magic-infused items to build their nests, adding the solar dragon has consumed many adventurers, so they must defeat it. Fern fires Zoltraak at the dragon, but the mana disperses against its scales. She tells Frieren the spell failed. As the dragon wakes, Frieren instructs Fern to run and leaves her. Fern narrowly escapes, and Frieren suggests repeating the attempt until they defeat the dragon. A shaken Fern grabs Frieren, who realizes mages don't play tag with dragons, patting Fern's head. Frieren decides they need a companion. 

A flashback reveals Eisen talking with Frieren at night while Fern is asleep. Eisen tells Frieren to recruit a warrior named Stark near Riegel Canyon if they are looking for a vanguard. Eisen tells her to pick him up along the way and that Stark is his apprentice. Frieren asks if he is a good warrior to which Eisen responds with a serious face as the flashback ends.

As Fern and Frieren walk through the nearby village, Fern remarks that the village is remarkably peaceful and that it is hard to believe there is a dragon nearby. Fern asks what magic spell is contained in the grimoire that Frieren wants, and Frieren responds that it was a spell that lets one see through clothes. Fern notes that Frieren really does collect odd spells as Frieren justifies it as a hobby. Frieren attempts to explain the practicality of the spell before an elderly woman approaches the two, explaining that Stark would like to meet them.

The elderly villager explains that three years ago, the dragon attacked the village before Stark stood before the dragon in a tense standoff which resulted in the dragon leaving the village. Since then, Stark has stayed in the village and the dragon has not attacked, contributing to the peace. Fern speculates that they may be able to defeat the dragon with Stark's help as Frieren hopes that that is true.

At the base of a cliff, a child asks Stark if he can become a powerful warrior like him, and Stark replies in the affirmative, though adding that a warrior's job isn't particularly noble. As Frieren, Fern, and the elderly villager arrive, Stark tells Frieren and Fern to not mess around with the dragon as it could put the village in danger again. To this end, Stark shows a scar on his forehead from fighting a Shadow Dragon, but Frieren cuts him off and says that such injury isn't serious at all. Stark realizes that his master may have put the two up for this and asks who they are. Frieren introduces herself, prompting Stark to tell the villagers to give him privacy, assuring them that Frieren and Fern are acquaintances of his master.

Stark assumes Eisen must be furious with him. Frieren questions why Stark hasn't defeated the dragon, given he has no reason to stay in the village. Stark dodges the question, instead asking what they want; if they are trying to convince him to return to his master, he refuses. Frieren explains they need a vanguard and seek his help in defeating the solar dragon to acquire a grimoire. Stark questions her motives, as fighting a solar dragon is no trivial matter.

A brief flashback occurs of Frieren casting a spell that manipulates stones as puppets and commands the golem to dance to the amazement of the Hero Party.

In response to Stark's argument, Frieren explains that there was once an idiot who would compliment the spells that she collected, which she assumes should be a good enough reason for Stark. Stark finds such reasoning ridiculous but he reluctantly agrees to accompany Frieren and Fern, suspecting Eisen instructed them to take him along. However, Stark admits he struggled against the solar dragon alone and questions Frieren's ability to defeat it. Frieren assures him, stating she can overcome it if Stark can immobilize the dragon for thirty seconds. Stark asks if he really has to, prompting Frieren to inquire about his combat experience. Stark humorously confesses to lacking any experience and admits freezing in fear when confronting the solar dragon. He believed the dragon spared him on a whim, but the villagers revered him as a hero, complicating his departure due to their kindness.

In response, Fern disdainfully looks down on Stark and suggests seeking another companion. However, Frieren insists she believes in Stark's ability to confront the dragon. Frieren examines a massive crack on the cliff's base, then she and Fern depart. Frieren grants Stark one night to decide whether he'll assist them, stating that he knows that he can't continue his current situation.

Later, at a restaurant, the proprietors, a man and his wife, praise Stark to Frieren and Fern. Fern remarks on Stark's popularity, to which Frieren comments on his apparent kindness. Fern disagrees, finding him cowardly. Frieren doesn't contradict but recalls Fern's own initial encounter with monsters, to which Fern to pouts in frustration. As they leave, Fern wonders why the dragon hasn't attacked the village. A sudden noise interrupts, and Frieren attributes it to Stark, suggesting Fern to check on him if she is curious.

Back in her room, Frieren remembers Eisen's remarks about Stark's power. Eisen, stern-faced, reveals Stark was a coward who fled when his hometown was attacked by monsters, likening the young boy to himself. Because of this, Eisen trained Stark everything he knew to fight for others. Frieren, with a smile, asserts he must be a capable warrior then.

Meanwhile, the crack in the base of the cliffside is revealed to be the work of Stark, who continuously uses his axe to strike the cliff with his Lightning Strike technique. Fern, realizing this, approaches Stark, who turns around.

## [ARCS] Episode 6
**The Hero of the Village** ｢村 (むら) の英 (えい) 雄 (ゆう) , *Mura no eiyū*?｣ is the sixth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on October 13, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Frieren and Fern enlist Stark's help to fight the solar dragon - but is he up to the task?

## Plot]

After Fern discovers Stark training at night, she asks why he stills trains if he does not intend to fight the solar dragon. He replies that the villagers think of him as a hero so he must protect the village, although he feels like he will run away. Stark reveals that even the scar on his forehead is something he got when he argued with Eisen over his aversion to fighting monsters, as he was disappointed in him. Ultimately, Stark was never once praised by his master. Fern takes a look at his hand and sees how roughed up it is and understands how hard he has trained.

Fern tells Stark that she does not think he would not run, even though she does not know a single thing about him, because she recalls a fearful experience from when she fought her first monster. She had trained much more than necessary up to that day. However, she was seized by fear and ran, chased by the monster, and Frieren refused to help her. When she finally resolved herself and turned to face the monster, her body took action on its own, and she successfully defeated it. Fern tells Stark that she believes his resolve to protect the village is genuine, and she leaves him for the night.

The next day, Frieren and Fern go to the cliffside but do not find Stark there. As they are about to go “play tag” with the dragon, Stark arrives. He makes Frieren promise that if he were to die in the midst of battle, she will kill the dragon no matter what. Frieren asks why he is going to such lengths for the villagers. Stark thinks it is a strange question since he has been in the village for three years now. Frieren calls that ephemeral, while Stark replies that it is eternity.

They head towards the dragon and Stark's hands start shaking, leading him to conclude that what's scary is scary after all. Frieren laughs, saying he is just like Eisen, and recalls a memory from when the Hero Party was about to battle a huge monster. Frieren asked Eisen if he was scared since his hands were shaking, and he admitted it quickly, saying fear is not a bad thing, as it is that fear which carried him throughout the Hero Party's journey. Frieren tells Stark that even the way he shakes is the same as Eisen, making Stark smile.

Stark approaches the dragon while Frieren and Fern stand by and watch from afar. Fern notes how the dragon does not attack, and Frieren replies it is because it is being vigilant, and realizes why the village has not been attacked. She explains that dragons are intelligent creatures. They are not foolish enough to antagonize powerful enemies. She reveals that when Eisen hit Stark, it was not because he was weak or because he was a disappointment, and recalls the memory of when she was talking to Eisen back when he traveled with her and Fern. Eisen tells Frieren that he fought with Stark and broke apart. His body reacted on its own and he hit him because he was scared of Stark. He called Stark amazing and said that his disciple will become an incredible warrior.

In the present, Stark manages to deal a fierce blow to the dragon and knock it down. He then shouts to Frieren and Fern to fire at it nonstop, but Frieren stops Fern from doing so. Anxious, Stark screams, asking why they aren't firing, calling Frieren a "old hag" and saying that she is no different from his master. Frieren tells him that the dragon is already dead, surprising Stark. Frieren praises him, then proceeds to loot the dragon's nest. Stark tells her that Eisen once said that the Hero Party's adventure became a deplorable yet incredibly fun journey all because of Frieren, making her smile and recall an old memory.

Frieren uses magic she just found in a dungeon to create shaved ice for Heiter while Eisen and Himmel converse from the side. Eisen calls it deplorable while Himmel does not think of it as a big deal as the journey has just begun. Eisen states that even the Hero of the South, said to be the most powerful in all of mankind was defeated by the Seven Sages of Destruction who answer directly to the Demon King and that they are not even sure if they can return alive. Himmel asks Eisen if he wants a painful and bitter journey instead then, to which Eisen doesn't answer. Himmel states that wants to have a fun journey that they can laugh at in retrospect, even if it turned out to be deplorable. Stark decides to join Frieren and Fern on their voyage, as his master told them to take Stark with them, and also because he would like to experience a deplorable journey as well.

Twenty-eight years after the Hero Himmel's passing, Frieren, Fern, and Stark are in the Central Lands, specifically the fortress city of Waal near the Riegel Canyon.

They try to enter the north, but the Captain of the Guard tells them that passage through the barrier to the Northern Lands has been prohibited because it is brimming with monster activity, and it is unknown when it will open again. Frieren nonchalantly decides that their party should relax in Waal for the time being, and she remarks how she can finally leisurely research magic after so long. The party splits up, with Frieren going to check in at an inn, and Stark going to get some food. Fern overhears passersby talking about how it might take at least two years before the barrier reopens.

Stark orders a Jumbo Berry Special at a bar, making him feel nostalgic about how he used to split it with his master when he could not finish it as a kid. He comments on how small it looks now and has a conversation with the bartender. Fern also appears in the same bar and asks Stark if he would like the idea of staying in the town for at least two years, which he denies, relieving Fern.

They leave the bar and Stark agrees to help Fern look for a way to get over the barrier. He suggests flying over it, but that would not work because the national border with the Northern Lands has a powerful magical barrier stretching up to the skies, otherwise aerial monsters would get in. Stark and Fern go inquire at the merchant's guild, and they discover that trade has been completely blocked. As Fern is about to give up, Stark suggests asking around at more dangerous areas, such as the black market and the thieves' guild. 

They continue searching throughout Waal but are unsuccessful. Stark then suggests they should try the guard station next, which makes Fern ask why he seems so desperate to get out of the city, even moreso than herself. He tells her that he does not have that much time left and that his master once brought him to Waal. They saw the clear landscape of the north and Stark asked him about his adventure with the Hero Party, of which Eisen happily told him stories about. Stark says that his master is no longer at an age capable of going on a journey, so he wishes to thoroughly indulge in his deplorable yet fun journey with Frieren and Fern to bring back plenty of travel tales to share with him, as this is what he can do to repay Eisen.

As Stark and Fern walk in town, they see Frieren trying to hide from something. Suddenly, the Captain of the Guard and the Castellan of Waal appear and ask for Frieren's forgiveness. Frieren tries to speak, but the castellan talks about how it appears she is planning to embark towards the north again to stop the conflicts being caused by the remnants of the Demon King and gives Frieren's party passage through the barrier.

With great fanfare, the trio walks towards the barrier. Fern asks if they could not have declared Frieren's name to begin with, and Frieren answered that she thought that it would not work even if they did. Stark is happy to witness this kind of scene, as his master embarked for the north like they currently are as well. Frieren recalls the celebration when the Hero Party ventured northwards, and agrees. The trio pass through the barrier and continues their voyage into the north.

## [ARCS] Episode 7
**Like a Fairy Tale** ｢おとぎ話 (ばなし) のようなもの, *Otogibanashi no yō na mono*?｣ is the seventh episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on October 20, 2023.

## Synopsis]

After reflecting on the transient nature of the past as it exists in people's collective memories, Frieren unexpectedly runs into a sworn enemy.

## Plot]

The Hero Party is depicted walking, having obtained a grimoire purportedly authored by the Great Mage Flamme as a reward for their monster-slaying endeavors. Frieren notes that Flamme-attributed books are usually forgeries, though she remarks that this one is the best imitation she has come across. Himmel fails to grasp the grimoire's value, while Heiter suggests that exposure to constant imitations might lead one to doubt the existence of the real thing. Eisen adds that Flamme, humanity's magic founder, is akin to a fairy tale, prompting Frieren to reflect on time's passage and her being the only one to remember Flamme's face.

In the present, Frieren wakes up early, much to Fern's surprise. Fern insists on praising Frieren for waking up early, leading Fern and Stark to indulge her with food and a massage, much to Frieren's delight.

Twenty-eight years after Hero Himmel's passing, Frieren, Fern, and Stark assist a merchant in clearing a landslide on the Eng Road in the Northern Lands. The merchant expresses gratitude, while Stark questions the necessity of their labor, suggesting they could fly the merchant's cart to the other side. Frieren insists on clearing the blockage for the benefit of future travelers, at least according to Fern, and chides Stark for his perceived selfishness. Stark retorts, refusing to accept criticism from her.

During a break, Stark asks about the cause of landslides in the area. The merchant attributes them to frequent skirmishes against demons in the Northern Lands, likely contributing to such natural disasters, including the current landslide. As Stark begins working, Fern politely requests his assistance on her side of the landslide. Stark hesitates, suggesting Fern drop the honorifics since they are similar in age. However, he is surprised when Fern complies but begins to speak rudely. Stark sulks, expressing his desire for a friendlier interaction and admitting his sensitivity. Fern remarks on Stark's bothersome nature before reverting to polite address, and the trio resumes their work.

After completing their work, the trio is invited to be escorted by the merchant to the nearby town. The merchant expresses surprise at encountering an elf for the first time despite his old age. Frieren acknowledges the rarity of elves, revealing her limited encounters with her own kind. She explains that despite elves' longevity, their lack of romantic and reproductive instincts contributes to their gradual extinction. As she reflects on her last encounter with an elf four centuries ago, Frieren realizes that elves may be closer to extinction than she previously thought.

As they reach the town, Fern observes a long line of wagons. The merchant explains that the town is celebrating its annual Liberation Festival, commemorating Himmel and the Hero Party's victory against |demons in the area. He describes how the statues of the Hero Party will be adorned, and the entire town will celebrate grandly. Frieren comments on humans' inclination to create festivals for various occasions. The merchant reminds her that over 80 years have passed since the demons were defeated, yet everyone still remembers the Hero Party on this day.

In a flashback, Himmel examines a bronze statue of himself, expressing satisfaction with its quality. Eisen and Heiter remark on the efficient production process. Frieren comments on Himmel's penchant for commissioning statues, prompting him to explain his desire for their memory to endure beyond their lifetimes. He jests about his own handsomeness, but before Frieren leaves, Himmel reveals the true purpose of the statues: to ensure they are remembered as more than just fairy tales.

Back in the present, the trio observe the statues of the Hero Party during the festival at night. The merchant notes Frieren's resemblance to her statue. Frieren questions the festival's longevity, wondering if it will endure for a century or a millennium. The merchant says it will continue for as long as the town stands but is unsure about a millennium. 

The following morning, the trio departs from the town. Stark asks about their destination, and Frieren cryptically replies, "Heaven," to which Stark responds that it sounds fun.

Later, Frieren, Fern and Stark are in Graf Granat's Domain in the Northern Lands. As the party walks through the town, Fern looks around and notes that there are many guards in town, remarking that something must have happened. Suddenly, Frieren takes a pause before dropping her suitcase and summoning her staff to attack. Concerned, Fern tries to intervene, reminding her that they are in town. However, Frieren, sensing the presence of demons, prepares to attack as three demons emerge alongside Graf Granat. 

One of the demons notices Frieren's hostile intent just as she is restrained by a guard. The demons approach Frieren and one asks the Graf if he had put her up to such an act. Addressing the demon as Lügner, Granat asserts that he is not foolish enough to attack peace envoys in the middle of the town despite his hatred for demons. He suggests that the incident could have been a misunderstanding by unaware adventurers. Kneeling before Frieren, Lügner acknowledges the bloodlust in her eyes, likening her attitude to that towards wild beasts rather than people. Frieren responds, asserting her belief that demons are nothing more than untamed creatures mimicking human speech, incapable of true communication. The Graf orders the guards to throw Frieren into the dungeon beneath the mansion for her actions, and they comply, carrying Frieren away.

In the dungeon, Fern and Stark engage in conversation with a sentinel before proceeding to visit Frieren in her cell. Stark informs Frieren that she has been sentenced to reflect on her actions for a period of two to three years, a punishment Frieren anticipated to be more severe. Frieren then requests grimoires from them, prompting Fern to express discontent at Frieren's apparent willingness to pass the time. 

When Frieren asks about the presence of the peace envoys, Fern attributes it to Aura the Guillotine, whom Frieren identifies as one of the Seven Sages of Destruction serving under the Demon King that went into hiding following conflicts with the Hero Party and the depletion of her forces. Fern elaborates that Aura regained her forces 28 years ago, and her prolonged conflict with the town ultimately led to exhaustion, prompting the dispatch of peace envoys. Frieren criticizes the decision to permit the demons into town, firmly convinced that any attempt at dialogue with them is futile. Stark challenges her viewpoint, advocating for communication by highlighting the demons' capacity for speech. Frieren asserts the inherent incapacity of demons for meaningful resolution made it pointless, leading her to ask why he thinks the man-eating demons share a language with humans in the first place.

Frieren thinks back to a memory where an injured, childlike demon was surrounded by the Hero Party and vengeful villagers who called for the demon's death. Himmel hesitated at the sight of the demon's appearance, prompting one villager to lament that the demon had consumed her daughter. Despite his initial resolve, Himmel wavered when the demon cried out for its mother. Frieren, sensing the hesitation, moved to deliver the fatal blow, only to be halted by the village chief. The chief advocated for the demon's redemption, arguing that without such opportunities, they would be no different from the demons themselves. Despite objections from the villagers, the chief offered the demon a chance to work on his farm. Frieren cautioned Himmel that he may regret this, but Himmel, citing their shared ability to communicate, dismissed her concerns. 

Time passed as the demon was given the opportunity to integrate into the community. However, one fateful night, the demon stood before the mortally wounded village chief and his burning home, holding the chief's daughter. When questioned by Himmel about the chief's death, the demon pointed to the villagers' hostility and expressed a desire for peace. To this end, the demon offered the chief's daughter to the bereaved couple whose daughter had been eaten, horrifying the villagers. Recognizing that she may have made a mistake, the demon moved to hold the chief's daughter as a hostage, only to have her hands swiftly severed by Himmel. Conceding to Frieren's earlier warning, Himmel permitted her to end the demon's life. As the demon faded away, Frieren questioned why it had called out to a mother if demons were solitary creatures with no concept of family. The demon offered a simple explanation: invoking such words often spared them from death.

Back in the present, Frieren explains that words are simply a means of deception for demons, citing Great Mage Flamme's definition of demons as monsters capable of speech descended from monsters that would lure humans by crying for help. As Fern and Stark take their leave, Frieren reminds them to bring her grimoires.

In Graf Granat's mansion, Draht notes the Graf's tardiness, which Lügner attributes to a diplomatic strategy. Lügner redirects the conversation to Frieren, recognizing her appearance and acknowledging her insight into the true nature of demons. Meanwhile, Frieren surmises that the town's fate looks bleak and plots her escape amidst the confusion.

Later, the three demon envoys are ushered into Graf Granat's son's room. The Graf fondly reminisces about his son as he handles his sword, prompting Lügner to inquire about the son's whereabouts. Granat reveals his son's demise a decade prior in battle against Aura's forces, then brandishes the sword against Lügner as guards converge on the demons. The Graf confesses that he only brought the demons to town as envoys to execute them, doubting the sincerity of demon peace. Lügner notices the well-preserved state of Granat's deceased son's room and shares that he does the same for his late father's room, lost to human violence. Seeing Granat's distress, Lügner advises him to refrain from further bloodshed and grief. Granat relents and orders the demons to be taken to the guest room.

As the three demons walk away, Linie asks Lügner what a father is, to which Lügner smiles as he himself is unsure. Lügner notes that the Graf is an empathetic man that they may be able to win over and convince to lower the town's defensive barrier, paving way for Aura's forces to raze the town. Lügner asks Linie where Draht is, and she explains that Draht mentioned he was off to eliminate an obstacle.

In the dungeon, a jail cell guard tells Draht that he is not supposed to be there and requests he go back to the guest room. However, Draht immediately decapitates the guard with a thin wire emerging from his finger. As he approaches Frieren's cell, Draht identifies himself as one of Aura the Guillotine's executioners, and he discloses his intent to eliminate Frieren. Internally, Draht calculates that by eliminating Frieren and winning over Graf Granat, the town will succumb effortlessly. Frieren stares at Draht and issues a stern warning of her strength.

## [ARCS] Episode 8
**Frieren the Slayer** ｢葬 (そう) 送 (そう) のフリーレン, *Sōsō no Furīren*?｣ is the eighth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on October 27, 2023.

## Synopsis]

As tensions in Graf Granat's domain reach a breaking point, Fern and Stark find their own resolve - and Frieren resumes an old duty.

## Plot]

After Draht confronts Frieren in the mage's cell, he expresses doubt about Frieren's claim of being stronger than not only him but also Aura the Guillotine. Draht uses his mana-infused magic wire to hang Frieren by the neck, confident that he has already won. However, Frieren remains unphased, channeling mana around her neck to prevent decapitation. Draht, noting Frieren's calmness, claims that any other mage would have been decapitated before they could react. Believing that he can slice through Frieren's mana, Draht boasts that his wire is among the strongest in demon magic and is impervious to the magic of humankind. 

Frieren agrees with Draht's assessment but notes the overconfidence and inexperience of the current generation of demons. She then immediately severs Draht's hand with a spell, breaking free from the wire. Astonished, Draht attempts another attack using his wires, but Frieren swiftly severs his remaining hand and grabs him by the neck. Draht desperately tries to plead, but Frieren kills him instantly, leaving his body to disintegrate. Frieren internally considers that with the first demon down, she may be granted amnesty by Graf Granat if she were to report Draht's attack and eliminate the remaining two demons. Frieren then exits her dungeon cell to find the jail cell guard decapitated.

Meanwhile, as Fern and Stark eat a meal, Stark mentions that his master had once said a town with good food must be peaceful, believing that such a statement applies in this situation. Fern finishes her food quickly and stands up, telling Stark that they should appeal to Graf Granat for Frieren's release. She stresses that it is only a matter of time before the town is attacked if Frieren does not take down the demons. Stark agrees that it is their only option since neither of them is strong enough to take on the demons. He asserts that the demon named Lügner is unbelievably powerful, and he begins to tremble as he recalls their first encounter, remarking that Lügner only had eyes for Frieren because, in his mind, he could kill anyone else whenever he wished. 

Stark attempts to take a sip of his drink, but he wets his pants due to his trembling hand. Fern hands Stark a handkerchief and urges him to depart soon. While cleaning himself, Stark comments that Lügner would be near the Graf, making it hard to avoid combat. Fern asserts that the Hero Party would have gone regardless of the risk. Stark, resolving himself, agrees knowing that he would not be able to face his master if he cowers in fear. As they prepare to leave, Fern notices Stark still hasn't moved and asks if he has a problem as the latter admits that his knees are already weak.

Meanwhile, in Graf Granat's mansion, Linie notes that she can no longer sense Draht's mana, and Lügner surmises that he must already be dead. Linie derides Draht for being careless, but Lügner reminds her that they are Aura's personal executioners and would not simply die from letting their guard down, leaving Linie to wonder who the imprisoned mage really is.

Graf Granat enters the room with his guards, letting the demons know that the imprisoned Frieren has escaped from prison. Lügner offers to help search for her, stating that Linie is particularly skilled at detecting mana, a proposal promptly rebuffed by the Graf. Graf Granat questions the whereabouts of the third demon. Lügner calmly explains that Draht had merely gone to the restroom, but Granat notes that Draht had not asked any servant for directions. As the guards begin to surround Linie and Lügner, Granat declares that even he can tell how skilled Frieren was. He believes that her lack of resistance towards her initial arrest indicates her awareness of the severe consequences of killing a guard. The guards draw their swords as Granat asks once again where the third demon is. 

Lügner, expressing disdain of Draht for ruining the plan, bites into his own hand, creating a pool of blood. As the guards rush to attack him, they are all swiftly decapitated by Lügner's blood manipulation magic. Granat attempts to fight back, though he is easily overpowered. Lügner remarks that despite the failure of their original plan, he finds joy in resorting to violence. He questions the difference between words and weapons, asserting that the weak will inevitably die, just like Graf Granat's son. The Graf is outraged by Lügner's comment, but he is promptly pierced by Lügner's blood in the abdomen, causing him to drop to his knees. Lügner assures Graf Granat that he will not be killed, as he is necessary to remove the defensive barrier surrounding the town. 

As Fern and Stark move closer to the Graf's mansion, a hooded figure passes by them, which Fern immediately recognizes as Frieren. Frieren silently gestures toward an alley for the three of them to talk. She explains that she had no choice but to escape due to Draht's killing of the prison guard. The only evidence left of the encounter is Frieren herself, as demons disintegrate into mana upon death. Fern understands that Frieren will be executed if she is caught as the primary suspect for the guard's death, which is why Frieren intends to leave the town. Fern questions whether Frieren plans to abandon the town to the two remaining demons. In response, Frieren says that Fern and Stark are capable of taking them down themselves. The two, feeling discouraged, disagree, and Frieren questions whether they intend to not fight simply because their enemies are stronger. She reassures them that they are in no way weaker than the demons. 

Frieren starts to leave as Stark continues to plead for her help even if they were to fight. Fern drags Stark by his jacket, telling him to stop whining and to start facing reality with her. Frieren departs with a smile, before proceeding to internally speculate that the immense amount of mana that she is sensing must be about ten kilometers from town. Outside the town, Aura the Guillotine, one of the Seven Sages of Destruction, awaits with her army. With a smile, Frieren remarks that even she dislikes fighting strong enemies, which makes it all the better to confront them first.

Past sunset, Stark and Fern infiltrate Graf Granat's mansion by scaling the walls. Stark questions whether they are doing the right thing, to which Fern replies that it is better than telling the gatekeeper they are there to kill the messengers of peace. Meanwhile, Lügner talks to a bound Graf Granat about his love for magic. He explains that demons dedicate their entire lives to mastering a specific type of magic, much like the Elder Sage of Corruption Qual had done with the human-killing Zoltraak. While demons continually improve upon their magic, Lügner finds it absurd that there are geniuses, just like the Great Mage Flamme, whose magic continues to surpass modern achievements. A flashback of a thousand years ago depicts Frieren observing Flamme as she casts her barrier magic over a sapling. Lügner surmises that the demons being allowed entry into the town must mean that there is a spell that controls the town's barrier, and he orders Graf Granat to tell him what it is. The Graf chooses not to respond, prompting Lügner to leave to give the Graf more time to reflect on his next actions as more torture awaits if he remains silent. Lügner supposes that there must be a barrier grimoire somewhere and begins searching for it with Linie. 

Stark enters the room where Graf Granat is held captive, and the Graf remarks that he had thought that his deceased son had come to take him to the afterlife. Stark, still trembling, moves to free the Graf, who, sensing Stark's fear, commends his show of courage just like his son had done before his death. Stark struggles to cut through the magical ropes binding the Graf as the latter orders him to instead focus on evacuating the townspeople. Graf Granat tells Stark the guards will listen to him if he takes his emblem depicting his family's crest, and he reminds Stark that it is a crime to speak so casually to him. He tells Stark to leave, having already accepted his fate. Stark, ignoring the Graf's orders, apologizes in advance as he prepares to break the Graf's chair with no intention of paying him back. Before he follows through, Lügner and Linie return. Lügner asks if Stark is an acquaintance, to which Graf Granat replies that Stark simply did not know that his acquaintance had already escaped from prison. Lügner dismisses Stark without looking at him, reminding Stark how little he matters to the demon. 

Stark lands a swift strike on Lügner, but the demon uses his blood magic to overpower him and pin him to the ground. Lügner chides Stark for attacking recklessly but commends his bravery for attacking alone. Stark realizes that the demons are unable to detect Fern, creating an opening for the mage who appears behind the window and immediately fires a spell at Lügner, disintegrating his arm. Lügner is surprised that a mere human mage could bypass Linie's mana detection. Linie prepares to fight but is ordered to stop by Lügner, who asks what spell Fern used. Fern responds that it is an ordinary attack spell known as Zoltraak to the demons. Lügner dismisses this and claims that Demonkind already conquered Zoltraak half a century ago. He asks Fern who taught her the spell, to which Fern realizes that he is simply buying time. 

Before the fight resumes, Stark tells Fern that Granat's injuries are serious and that they must retreat. Lügner orders Linie not to fight Stark, stating that they will follow the humans through his blood after he finishes recovering. Linie expresses confidence in facing the two of them without Lügner, but Lügner tells Linie that she would have died if hit with Fern's spell, which has been modified to specifically kill demons and can no longer be called Zoltraak. Lügner reflects on Fern's movements and spell, which is reminiscent of someone he faced. He quickly realizes that this someone was Frieren the Slayer, known for her contribution to humankind's development and understanding of Zoltraak and for having killed the most demons in history. Lügner classifies Frieren as yet another genius who he despises. 

Around the same time, Frieren descends in front of Aura the Guillotine and her army of headless knights.

## Episode Notes]

- During the fight between Lügner and Graf Granat in the anime, Lügner deliberately cuts his finger on Graf Granat's sword to form a blood band that stabs the Graf's abdomen. This scene is unique to the anime, as the manga shows Lügner using his existing blood tendril to stab the Graf.

- The anime includes an additional scene based on a volume extra from Chapter 16 in the manga: When Fern drags Stark away after meeting with Frieren in the back alley, Stark laments their situation and Fern tells him not to be selfish.

- In the manga, Fern and Stark enter the mansion over a simple wall and then move right through the window, while in the anime, they pass a moat and have to climb/fly over a higher wall.
Fern's spell used to unlock a window latch during this infiltration is also anime original.

- The anime includes three original scenes when Lügner talks about Flamme's protective magic barrier:
The visual representation of a flying monster being blocked and killed by the protective barrier.

- Frieren noticing the monster dissipate as she ventures to the edge of the barrier on her way to face Aura.

- A flashback of Frieren watching Flamme setting up the barrier by placing a protective spell over a sapling peaking through snow.

- In the anime, just before Stark attacks Lügner, he has a brief flashback to when Frieren was apprehended by the guards when they first entered town, where Lügner only looked at Frieren. This does not exist as a panel in the manga.

## [ARCS] Episode 9
**Aura the Guillotine** ｢断 (だん) 頭 (とう) 台 (だい) のアウラ, *Dantōdai no Aura*?｣ is the ninth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on November 3, 2023.

## Synopsis]

While Fern and Stark make a temporary retreat with Graf Granat, Frieren's true foe awaits her outside the city.

## Plot]

Fern and Stark bring Graf Granat to a church, where a church father finishes healing and patching up his injury before taking his leave. Granat expresses his gratitude to Fern and Stark for saving his life, conceding that their companion mage will be forgiven as she had the right judgment about the demons. Stark suggests inviting Frieren back to the town to have her kill the demons, while Fern informs the Graf that Frieren was not the one who killed the prison guard. Graf Granat reveals that he already knew the demons were responsible and asks for confirmation that Frieren is the same mage from the Hero Party. Realizing this, he acknowledges that he had acted disrespectfully, given that the Granat family is indebted to the Hero Party for driving demons away from the town during his grandfather's days. Graf Granat reveals that their opponent at the time was the very same Sage of Destruction, Aura the Guillotine.

Meanwhile, Frieren and Aura confront each other, with Aura remarking that it has been about 80 years since their last encounter. Frieren calmly asks Aura and her army to turn back from the town, but Aura refuses. As Aura's knights attack, Frieren effortlessly dodges their strikes, asking Aura why she won't retreat. Aura claims it is because she holds an overwhelming advantage. Frieren comments that Aura seems to have more knights than before, attributing it to the powerful nature of demon magic. She goes on to say that while humankind cannot hope to match the level of demon magic, such spells are utterly repulsive. Scanning around her, Frieren recognizes some of the headless suits of armor as she declares her resolve to kill Aura. 

Graf Granat explains to Fern and Stark that the Scales of Obedience wielded by Aura was the sole reason that his forces were unable to win against Aura for years. He explains that the magic of the Seven Sages of Destruction is far beyond human comprehension, and Aura's particular spell allowed her to enslave her opponents. The Scales of Obedience allows Aura to compare the mana of two individuals, and the one with greater mana gains control over the other, turning them into a puppet forever. The obvious risks and fairness of the spell are rendered meaningless through Aura's overwhelming amount of mana, making her invincible to most but those with even greater mana. Graf Granat admits that it has been five hundred years since Aura became a Sage of Destruction and there has never been a single individual that has surpassed Aura's mana. Fern asks if there are any countermeasures against the demon's power, to which Graf Granat responds that those with strong wills—often found in courageous warriors—can resist Aura's control momentarily. A flashback shows a knight wielding the Granat emblem breaking free of Aura's control. With a tormented expression, Granat reveals that Aura systematically did something very cruel in response to this, alluding to her moniker and the headless army she controls.

Meanwhile, Frieren continues to dodge through the attacks of Aura's army as the latter boasts of her immortal army. In response, Frieren uses her staff and casts a spell that dispels Aura's control over the knights surrounding the elf. The undead knights collapse to the ground, leaving Aura visibly surprised. Aura claims that such a thing has never happened before, but points out that this must have drained a significant amount of mana. She then questions why Frieren would bother freeing the knights, noting that during their last encounter, Frieren simply blasted the knights away. Frieren reveals that Himmel got mad at her for doing so. Aura retorts that with Himmel no longer around, there's even more reason to continue as before. In response, Frieren remarks that demons truly are beasts she can kill without remorse.

At the Church, the priest explains to Stark that the area is safe as it is guarded by a magic barrier, albeit not as strong as the town's barrier. Stark, telling Graf Granat to rest up, prepares to go out, and Fern asks if he is sure as their initial attack only worked as a surprise and was not enough to kill Lügner. Fern believes that the two of them would be killed if they continued fighting, but Stark responds that someone has to take responsibility. Fern agrees to head out with Stark, but Stark tells her to head to the guardhouse instead to have the townspeople evacuated. Stark comically resolves to beg for Frieren's return on his knees, subverting Fern's expectations. Stark reasons that it was the only way to beat the demons, to which Fern ultimately agrees. Outside, Stark hands Fern the emblem depicting the Graf Granat's family's crest, which will ensure the guards listen to her, while he prepares to leave the town immediately.

Fern asks about Stark's condition, as his arms are covered in blood. Stark reassures her that such injuries are normal for warriors, which Fern doubts. Stark then points out that Fern also has blood on her, though he is unsure where it came from. Shocked, Fern quickly discards her robe, realizing that the blood has traces of mana in it. In an ambush, Fern is immediately pierced by Lügner's blood and pushed against the wall, while Linie engages Stark with a conjured axe and pushes him over the ledge of the castle. They land in a clearing below, and Stark recognizes the demon's axe movements as his master's techniques.

Meanwhile, Lügner tells Fern that he had no intention of missing her vitals and making her suffer. He asks the silent Fern why she was surprised, chalking it down to his recovery from a fatal wound and the demons ability to hide their mana just like Fern did. Fern remarks that Lügner speaks a lot and asks if he is not going to kill her. Lügner reveals that he wants to ask her a few questions first, assuming she does not wish to die immediately.

Lügner inquires about Stark's strength as Fern reveals that he is the apprentice of Eisen the Warrior, to which Lügner predicts that he will experience an unpleasant death against Linie. Lügner then asks Fern where Frieren is, and Fern reveals that the elf had fled town due to her being the key suspect of the killing of the prison guard. Lügner, unconvinced, doubts that Frieren would leave simply due to the threat of execution and wonders if she has gone to confront Aura instead. Fern breaks free and tells Lügner to not move. Fern reveals that she figured that Lügner had missed intentionally as retaliation for her surprise attack due to his pride and inability to see anyone but Frieren as a threat. Having given Fern an opening, Lügner taunts her into attacking as he will kill her in an instant if she does.

Fern recalls a past conversation with Frieren, which took place after they had eliminated a herd of cow-like monsters. Fern asked Frieren if she was of any use to the elf, and when Frieren questioned why she would want to know, Fern explained that she could not handle magic like her. Frieren responded that it is simply due to the difference in the time they have spent practicing, meaning that Fern would never catch up with regards to mana and technique. However, Frieren also noted that she always assigned Fern to eliminate monsters because battles ended faster when Fern was involved, attributing this to Fern's speed in casting spells.

As the flashback ends, Lügner tells Fern that he has dedicated his entire life to magic, to which Fern claims that she has done the same. Under the moonlight, the fight between Lügner and Fern begins. Lügner makes the first move but is immediately forced to block a spell aimed directly at his heart. The demon is surprised by Fern's reaction speed, and Fern attains the knowledge that Lügner's weak point is his heart. Acknowledging her skill, Lügner admits Fern wasn't lying about her dedication to magic and resolves to crush her with all his might. Lügner casts his signature spell: Balterie, as Linie observes from below the walls, revealing that she has already seemingly defeated Stark and that she will simply observe as Lügner does not like her meddling. Stark stands up, exclaiming that the battle has not yet ended, prompting Linie to prepare to attack again. 

Fern calmly approaches Lügner as she counters all of Lügner's spells. Although Lügner considers himself incomparably superior in mana, technique, and control, Lügner is slowly being pushed back by Fern's barrage of attacks due to her speed and overwhelming number of spells. Lügner wonders what sort of training Fern had gone through under Frieren as she looks down upon him and prepares to attack again. Lügner decides to force Fern into a war of attrition to exhaust her mana. However, Fern's continuous spellcasting rapidly breaks through his defenses, injuring his shoulder. Struggling to find an opening, Lügner orders Linie to dispose of Stark and come to his aid.

Meanwhile, Linie grows frustrated with Stark's persistence as he dodges her attacks. She eventually lands an axe blow on his head near his eye. Stark notices the similarities between Linie's axe-wielding and his master's techniques. Linie reveals that she specializes in reading people's mana and has memorized the way mana flows through them as they move, allowing her to replicate their techniques. Linie consecutively summons a variety of weapons, overpowering Stark at every turn. As she summons an axe, she remarks that Stark's movements resemble those of the greatest warrior in history, a technique she has memorized, and finds the encounter fateful. Stark, struggling, blocks Linie's attack with his axe as he internally resigns to never being able to beat his own master. Linie lands another hit on his shoulder before preparing to aid Lügner.

As Stark, beaten down, lays on the ground, he recalls being knocked down similarly while training with Eisen. Eisen ordered Stark to stand up and that he was not allowed to get knocked out no matter how battered he got. Stark responded that it was easier said than done, and he admitted that with his mindset, he could never beat Eisen. Eisen acknowledged this but emphasized that as long as Stark chose to stand up, he hadn't truly lost. Eisen revealed his trick to beating a strong opponent, which was to simply get back up and keep fighting until the last warrior is standing, making them the winner.

Remembering this lesson, Stark stands, exasperated by Eisen's logic. Linie sighs, saying Stark should have stayed down, as he has already lost. Stark asserts that he has not yet lost and that Linie's movements are a cheap imitation of his master's as they lack the true weight behind each attack. Linie summons her axe again and readies herself into a stance with Erfassen, determined to beat Stark with such imitation.

Lügner continues to engage Fern in battle as Stark decides to launch a seemingly reckless attack against Linie with no regard for defense. In response, Linie swings her axe in a counterattack but fails to slice through Stark's body. Stark is reassured to find out that Linie's attack truly had no power at all and his resolve to sacrifice himself was unneeded. In an instant, Stark lands a blow using his Lightning Strike which vertically cuts through Linie and makes her disintegrate after the kill. Distracted by Linie's death, Lügner is struck down by Fern's Zoltraak, ending the battle.

## [ARCS] Episode 10
**A Powerful Mage** ｢強 (つよ) い魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) 使 (つか) い, *Tsuyoi mahōtsukai*?｣ is the tenth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on November 10, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Frieren's many years of training under her teacher Flamme are tested in her confrontation with Aura the Guillotine. Will Aura's scales find her wanting?

## Plot]

Sometime in the past, Frieren questions her master if she considers their technique unfair, and Flamme reminds Frieren of the true nature of demons, where they use words to deceive humans and are nothing more than monsters that can speak. Flamme justifies that demons don't play fair this way, so they must use techniques that are even more unfair, and she is willing to perform dishonorably if it allows her to eradicate the demons.

Lügner lies against a wall after receiving his fatal wound and realizes the bleeding won't stop, signifying his defeat. Fern aims her staff at him and tells him that his plan has failed. He agrees but points out that Frieren will also suffer injuries if she is facing off against Aura, and the Hero Party that had previously forced Aura's army to retreat is no longer there to protect Frieren. He declares that although Frieren poses a threat, she still has less mana than Aura and will lose if they were to fight directly. Fern responds that Frieren will win, as she is not one to directly face a demon and will deceive Aura to defeat her. Lügner thinks of her words as nonsense and recalls his past encounter with Frieren, where she had fought them directly. He feels that something is off and wonders how Fern was able to overwhelm him with attacks without exhausting her mana, given it was so meager and fragile. The realization dawns on him and he wonders if such a technique is possible. He deduces that Frieren must employ the same technique and calls her and Fern disgraces for mages by using such an unfair approach. Fern replies that Frieren is well aware of the dishonor and blasts Lügner, killing him.

Some time long ago, Flamme walks through a barren elf village and comments on the destruction. She discovers a general of the Demon King's army, Basalt the Throne, laying dead, and concludes that he was likely the leader of the troops that caused the village's destruction. She addresses a young elf mage collapsed in front of the demon and questions if she was the one that defeated him, commenting that she looked like she was on the verge of death as well. Flamme analyzes the elf's steep mana and notes she must be powerful. She criticizes her for facing the demon head on when there were other options like fleeing or hiding and expresses that she doesn't understand the thoughts of powerful mages. The elf responds that Flamme should be able to understand, given that she is a much greater mage than herself, despite Flamme exhibiting a much weaker level of mana. Flamme questions why she thinks that, and she responds that she just has a hunch. Flamme then asks for the elf's name.

Flamme carries Frieren on her back as they leave the village. Frieren tells her that the village was completely wiped out, including the women and children, and she was unable to protect them despite being the strongest. Flamme calls her a fool and that she should've fled, but she tells her she has potential and will become her apprentice. She reminds her that, had she not come across the village, Frieren would've died in vain. As they continue on, Flamme detects pursuers, consisting of three demons more powerful than Basalt. She points out to Frieren that the demons were concealing their mana and planned on taking them by surprise, but they immediately revealed themselves out of confidence in their mana upon realizing Flamme and Frieren were mages. One of the demons commands Flamme to abandon Frieren and leave, and Flamme asks if she will be spared given she complies with their demand. The demon informs her that the Demon King ordered them to massacre the elves, and thus they do not care about Flamme's life.

Flamme lets Frieren onto the ground and tells her that she is, in fact, aware of what being a powerful mage feels like and how the demons feel: the demons have sheer confidence in the magic they pursue for their entire lives, and thus, they are arrogant and careless. Immediately, Flamme casts a giant explosion that results in the obliteration of the three demons, leaving a crater in the ground. A shocked Frieren witnesses the destruction, and Flamme discloses that the demons did not consider her a threat compared to Frieren, which ultimately resulted in their misjudgement and deaths. Frieren realizes that Flamme had limited her mana output to give enemies a false idea of her strength, and Flamme's true mana was at a much greater magnitude.

Flamme brings Frieren to her dwelling and treats her wounds. Later on, they begin training together, and Frieren tells Flamme that although she hates the demons and that they took everything from her, she still enjoys magic. Flamme concurs, and she emphasizes that only they need to be the ones that mock great magic. For training, Flamme instructs Frieren to limit her mana to one-tenth of her typical output while they work on other mage fundamentals. Frieren asks how long she is meant to restrict her mana, as limiting it for a prolonged amount of time tires her out, and Flamme responds that she will limit her mana and deceive demons for her entire life.

Back on the battlefield, Aura detects Lügner's death. Frieren tells Aura her plan has failed with the death of her associates, but Aura responds that as long as she can defeat Frieren, it would be enough. She asks if Frieren expending her mana to free the undead soldiers was the right call, which prompts Frieren to reflect on the workings of Auserlese and how Aura's status as a long-lived great demon would give her the confidence to use a risky spell so freely. As she recalls the demons' inability to mask their mana and voices her pity for Aura, Aura casts her Spell of Obedience: Auserlese.

In a flashback to the past, Frieren questions Flamme why demons do not employ the mana limiting strategy. Flamme responds that they're unable to, as demon hierarchy is established through strength in a similar manner to how human hierarchy is based on wealth. Demons have a physical display of this strength through their mana output, thus they cannot constantly limit their mana and rather do not even imagine doing so. Flamme observes Frieren's restricted mana, which she began three years prior, and praises her for competency.

Later on, a much older Flamme finds Frieren training and limiting her mana by a cliff. Flamme and Frieren discuss Frieren's moderate enjoyment of magic, and Flamme mentions that she only taught Frieren magic for fighting and revenge. However, she voices no regrets in doing so and entrusting her magic to Frieren, as her long lifespan will allow for her to one day defeat the Demon King. Flamme makes one final request to Frieren: to grow a field of flowers around her grave, as the spell she loves most and the one that made her fall in love with magic was the spell that creates a field of flowers, which was taught to her by her parents. Flamme advises her to keep out of the public eye and make a name for herself when she defeats the Demon King.

Flamme passes away shortly after, and Frieren complies with her last wish. She lives a modest and solitary life, watching civilization develop. Eventually, the Hero Party searches for and discovers her in the forest, where Himmel invites her to join their party and defeat the Demon King together. Although Heiter, a priest classifies her as an average mage through her mana, Himmel has a hunch that Frieren is stronger than any mage he has met before. Frieren ends up accepting their request, and the Hero Party makes their journey and ultimately ends up defeating the Demon King.

Back in the present, Aura casts Auserlese and places her soul and Frieren's soul on her Scales of Obedience. She inspects Frieren and her mana, considering Frieren to be a mage of unknown origin who only recently surfaced to defeat the Demon King with the Hero Party but with an unimpressive level of mana, equating to merely a hundred years of training with little change since the Demon King's defeat. Confident in her victory, Aura moves to personally behead Frieren and reflects that she was too cautious in trying to exhaust Frieren's mana. However, the scales begin tipping towards Frieren's soul, and Frieren reveals she was limiting her mana. Aura refuses to believe she would employ such a strategy and there was no instability shown in her mana that she could have overlooked. Frieren explains she has maintained a level of restraint on her mana for most of her life to the point of it feeling natural, and even if it was a ridiculous strategy, she is able to deceive and defeat demons through it. Aura desperately claims that she has lived over five hundred years as a great mage, and Frieren opposes her by revealing she is a mage that has lived for over a thousand years, subsequently revealing her true mana output. Aura falls under Frieren's control, and Frieren instructs her to kill herself. Aura is forced to comply, beheading herself.

## Episode Notes]

- The initial scene of a flashback with Frieren and Flamme is depicted later in the manga after Fern kills Lügner, during the flasback of Flamme and Frieren's history.

- In the anime, the three pursuing demons are shown to approach Flamme and Frieren from atop a hill, which makes the impact of Flamme's explosion spell more dramatic than in the manga where they encounter each other on flat ground.

- Unlike in the anime, the free-standing house in which Flamme lives and Frieren recovers is in the manga as the dwelling where the 1000-year-old tree grows on top (as seen in Episode 4).

- A panel of the manga that shows Flamme's parents teaching her the spell that creates a field of flowers was not adapted in the anime.

- During the montage of Frieren's journey with the Hero Party, the manga shows a panel that is assumed to depict the Hero Party facing off against the Demon King. This panel is replaced with a frame showing the Hero Party arriving at the Demon King's Castle in the anime.

## [ARCS] Episode 11
**Winter in the Northern Lands** ｢北 (きた) 側 (がわ) 諸 (しょ) 国 (こく) の冬 (ふゆ) , *Kitagawa Shokoku no fuyu*?｣ is the eleventh episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on November 17, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Frieren and her companions continue their journey through the northern lands, but obstacles both natural and manmade still stand in their way.

## Plot]

As the sun rises post Aura's defeat, Frieren walks past Aura's Scales of Obedience on the ground. She prays in front of the fallen soldiers, who have finally been released from Aura's control. Fern and Stark approach her after arriving at the battlefield via carriage. Fern comments on her victory and joins her prayer. Graf Granat arrives as well and is stunned by Aura's defeat at the hands of Frieren. Upon noticing the Graf, Frieren tries to escape with Fern and Stark under the presumption that she is still the primary suspect for the death of the jail guard. The Graf tells them that they have no need to leave, and Stark tells Frieren that they have been pardoned by the Graf. Graf Granat observes the remains and comments that despite the intensity of the battle, the damage to the fallen warriors was limited. He thanks them for their service towards the fallen heroes of the Northern Lands and Frieren in particular for the respect that she has paid them.

The Graf and his soldiers continue assessing the fallen soldiers while Frieren, Fern, and Stark watch from the carriage. Frieren reminisces on her previous battle against Aura back when she was part of the Hero Party and recalls the differences, mainly that her first battle against Aura led to a lot more collateral damage. Frieren comments that due to Himmel's anger, she has since changed her ways, and Stark and Fern both comment that Himmel is good at disciplining Frieren. She tells Fern not to refer to it as parenting but nevertheless agrees with Himmel's actions. She then praises Fern and Stark for defeating Lügner and Linie. The trio banter over their injuries, though Stark, as beaten up as he is, states it is normal for a warrior. Graf Granat tells his soldiers to give the deceased their proper funerals, and one of them points out a specific soldier with a necklace of the Granat family crest. Graf Granat, realizing that he has finally found his son, profoundly expresses his gratitude to Frieren.

Back within Graf Granat's Domain, the town is busy and Graf Granat grants Frieren a requested grimoire of Flamme as a reward. He asks Frieren if she is satisfied with just the grimoire of the protective barrier magic for her efforts, given that it is not about Flamme's protective barrier. Frieren states that she is aware of it being a fake and claims that collecting grimoires is her hobby. The Graf accepts her decision and requests that she no longer refer to him with formal speech, given that he is likely much younger than her. She notes that this habit is due to the difficult time the Hero Party had on their journey to defeat the Demon King, and Fern pitches in, as Heiter had told her about the Royal Capital's emphasis on treating nobles with respect, to the point of conferring capital punishment on those who failed to be respectful. Frieren thinks back fondly to Himmel and Eisen's near-execution in the Royal Capital for casually speaking to the King. This scares Stark, who feels capital punishment is going too far since he remembers speaking rather casually with the Graf when he tried to free him back in the mansion. He criticizes the Central Lands for their uncivilized methods while mockingly referring to the Graf with formalities. Immediately after, the Graf's gardner enters the room wielding an axe, much to Stark's horror.

The gardener informs Graf Granat that he has cut down a tree as requested, and the Graf thanks him. The regent admits to the party that he only mentioned punishment when Stark spoke casually to him to get him to escape from the demons, and since no law exists that punishes individuals for speaking informally in the domain, they have nothing to worry about. Fern moves to console Stark but notices he has passed out from shock. Fern uses floating magic to carry Stark and, before they leave the room, Graf Granat advises the party to take it easy, and the townsfolk all hope to thank them for their help after hearing of Aura's defeat.

The trio reside in the town for some time to take part in a celebration of Aura's defeat. They get their wounds from the battle treated, and Fern aids around the town with her magic. Stark becomes acquainted with the townsfolk's kids and has another scare in a chance encounter with the Graf's gardener. They receive lavish gifts from Graf Granat, including a set of new winter outfits for northern travel. A large funeral for the fallen soldiers is held, which Frieren's Party attends.

In preparation to depart and travel further north, the trio meets after completing their shopping. The Graf offers to escort them out. He explains that he heard Frieren is likely heading for Ende, where the Demon King's Castle is, and he informs the party that traveling in the Northern Plateau is restricted due to rough conditions. He reveals that even adventurers require accompaniment by a first-class mage. Fern assumes they should be fine given that Frieren is with them, but her master is unaware of what determines a first-class mage. Fern explains that it is a mage qualification granted by the Continental Magic Association, and she herself obtained a third-class qualification at the Holy City before she left for their journey. Frieren voices her unfamiliarity with modern-day mage qualifications and Fern realizes Frieren may actually be an unqualified black mage, much to the elf's contempt. Frieren points out that qualifications are constantly changing due to changes in the organizations that regulate magic, and she is not able to obtain every possible qualification, which means that her Holy Emblem may also be useless.

Stark remarks that even he is aware of the Continental Magic Association given that they have existed for at least half a century. Frieren refutes the statement and thinks half a century is still very new, and the constantly changing regulations are a pain. Fern brings up that there should be a place in the Northern Lands where mages could take the first-class exam. Graf Granat affirms this and says that an exam is being held in the city of Äußerst, the largest magical city in the Northern Lands. However, traveling there will require a long journey through the Schwer Mountains. With a new destination in sight, the Graf wishes Frieren and her party safe travels as they depart Graf Granat's domain. 

On their way to the mountains, snow begins to fall as winter arrives. Frieren explains that winters in the north can get bitter, so they should be careful, as most deaths during the war against the Demon King's forces were attributed to the northern winters.

Twenty-eight years after Himmel's passing, Frieren's party reaches the Decke Region. Despite not even setting foot in the Schwer Mountains, the trio experience a severe snowstorm. While Frieren comments that they are lost, Stark collapses. Due to wind gusts, the mages are unable to carry him with magic, so they resort to carrying him conventionally, which Fern takes up. Fern bears with a mumbling, half-conscious Stark until they reach a cabin that Frieren remembers was at the foot of the mountains eighty years ago. Upon arriving, Frieren opens the door to see a tall man with pointy ears doing squats. Fern immediately drags Frieren out, apologizes for the intrusion, closes the door, and tells Frieren that they need to go somewhere else, as there is a pervert inside. Before they can get away, the man opens the door and asks if Frieren is also an elf.

Everyone heads inside the cabin and they start a conversation. The elf tells Frieren that this is the first time in three-hundred years that he has encountered another elf, and he even wondered if their species had already gone extinct. He thanks Fern for the fire she started with her magic, as he had lost his coals in the blizzard and was unable to light a fire himself. As a result, he had to resort to doing squats to warm himself up. He introduces himself as Kraft the monk, and Frieren and Fern proceed to introduce themselves and Stark. When Kraft learns that Frieren's party is traveling to Aureole, he says that their devotion is admirable, but Frieren responds that she is only half devoted. The conversation is cut short because Fern informs them that Stark's temperature is dropping.

Stark has a feverish dream, where he sees Eisen alongside a huge jumbo-berry special sundae. After a while, Stark wakes up to see that he is sleeping next to Kraft, who is keeping him warm, which alarms Stark. He nervously asks who the guy he is sleeping next to is, and Kraft takes his comment in stride and tells Stark that he should be thanking him for warming him up. Stark then compliments Kraft's body, saying that it is nice. Fern gets the wrong idea and Stark clears up the confusion, saying he was referring to his well-trained body, and he deduces that the elf is very strong. He then asks for Kraft's name and comments that he has not heard of him, but believes that he is a famous monk. Kraft then tells Stark to rest and asks Frieren and Fern to help him carry some food from his cart, which is located nearby.

They reach Kraft's stranded cart which has frozen food, and he tells them to take as much as they wish because there is plenty. Frieren looks at the Schwer Mountains and decides they should stay in the cabin a bit longer since hiking in the blizzard would be suicidal. While returning to the cabin with the supplies, Kraft asks Frieren if she knows who he is, which she negates. He figures as such, since he also knows nothing about Frieren. Fern tells him that Frieren was the mage of the Hero Party and Kraft asks what she was before. Frieren asks what he is implying, and he answers that they are elves. 

Half a year passes, with Frieren's party and Kraft spending their days in the cabin and passing the time with chores and training while waiting for the weather to improve. They have meals together, where Fern and Kraft, in devoted habit, pray before eating. Soon, Stark also joins the prayer, and finally, Frieren joins in as well. Signs of warmer weather eventually show.

One day, Frieren and Kraft are in the forest having a conversation while Kraft whittles away at a wood carving for a necklace. Kraft thanks Frieren and her party for helping him survive and asks Frieren to give the handmade necklace to Fern, complimenting her for her strong devotion to the Goddess. He thinks her piousness stems from the fact that she was raised by a priest. Frieren asks Kraft why he believes in the Goddess, claiming that apart from mythical times, she has never shown herself throughout the long history of the world. Kraft then states that Frieren must be young, since he was doubtful like her in the past, but now he truly believes in the Goddess. He says that he would be troubled if the Goddess did not exist, or rather, he *needs* the Goddess to exist. Since everyone who knew about his great accomplishments has long passed. He imagines that the Goddess would honor him by giving him praise for his life well lived. Kraft says that it is cruel that nobody will remember the tracks they left in their lives. Frieren then says that being remembered is just a wish that elves have, and Kraft rhetorically asks if that isn't Heaven as well. Kraft then changes the subject, asking Frieren to tell him about her, as if she does not believe in the Goddess, he will honor her himself. This causes Frieren to recall a memory of when she was traveling with the Hero Party.

In the flashback, Himmel and Eisen were surrounded by happy children while Frieren sat at a table talking to Heiter. Frieren said she never imagined Heiter would donate towards the reconstruction of an orphanage, so the fact he did surprised her. Heiter told Frieren that he was also an orphan, and he believed that the Goddess would honor him for living purely and righteously. Frieren disagreed with this and asked what the corrupt priest is saying while getting drunk. Heiter suddenly asked her if she had anyone to honor her, and she asked why. Heiter explained that it seemed that she does not believe in the Goddess and that if she told him about herself, he will honor her in the Goddess's place. Frieren said that she has been living leisurely until now, so she has not done anything worthy of being honored. Heiter stated that despite this, she had dedicated her life to constantly limiting her mana. Frieren was surprised that Heiter noticed, but she remarked that her story was not an interesting one. Heiter said that he does not mind and her story would be good for future reference, since his child might become a mage. Frieren questioned Heiter about his statement, since priests are supposed to be single for life, which made Heiter laugh.

Back in the present, Frieren wonders why so many strange people believe in the Goddess as she watches Stark and Fern clear the cabin's roof of snow. She says to Kraft that she will pass on his offer, since she already has somebody to praise her. Kraft thinks that she has good friends and tells Frieren to treasure them. This makes Frieren pause for a moment before she explains that her friend is already in Heaven. Kraft says that means Frieren will see him again one day, to which Frieren agrees.

Later, once warmer weather has set in, Frieren's party and Kraft part ways and continue their separate adventures. Kraft tells Frieren that he does not consider this their final farewell before they split up, and that he will see her again, however many centuries later.

## Locations in Order of Appearance]

- Graf Granat's Domain

- Royal Capital (flashback)

- Decke Region

## Episode Notes]

- The anime shows a closeup of Aura's Scales of Obedience lying on the ground, the only thing remaining of the demon. This closeup is not included in the manga.

- When showcasing the return to normalcy within Graf Granat's Domain, the anime shows a boy petting a cat before the meeting between Frieren's Party and Graf Granat. Although this has no corresponding panel in the manga, a cat is part of a panel during the montage depicting the moments Frieren's party spends while celebrating Aura's defeat with the townsfolk. The scene of the boy petting the cat was also used in Episode 8, when Stark and Fern have a meal and plan to get Frieren out of the prison.

- As with other flashbacks of this scene, the anime represents the flashback of Himmel and Eisen facing capital punishment through an executioner swinging a sword, but in the manga, Himmel and Eisen are depicted with their heads fixated in a guillotine.

- During the montage after Frieren's party's audience with Graf Granat, the anime has an original frame showing the Graf being in thought while in his son's room with the sword.

- In the manga, a map of the northern continent is in the background when the Graf sees Frieren's party off to the gates and tells them that travel in the north is restricted. The anime does not adapt it to this part of the conversation, but it is shown later when the Graf informs the mages about Äußerst. The manga also has a part of the map shown in this scene.

- When Fern shows Frieren her third-class mage certificate granted by the Continental Magic Association, the text on the certificate on the initial aired version of the episode says "Certificate of Third-Rank Magician." This was changed in the final blu-ray version of the episode to be "Certificate of Third-Class Mage" instead.

- In the manga, Frieren has already taken a step into the cabin before getting yanked out by Fern, while she just apologizes in the anime for the interruption.

- The anime scene of Stark's dream while being warmed up is extended compared to the manga by adding the illusion of Eisen and a jumbo-berry special. In the manga, Stark only mentions the dream while he is unconscious and being dragged through the snow by Fern.

- The manga panels shows Kraft, Frieren, and Fern carrying the supplies from Kraft's cart through a snowstorm, however, the anime has the mages use a spell that makes things float to transfer the items once better weather conditions arrive.

- The iconography of the Goddess of Creation on the mantelpiece of the chimney in the cabin is anime original. However, in the manga, Kraft and Fern engage in discussion of the Holy Scripture, which is not part of the montage in the anime. Additionally, the manga does not show Stark and Frieren joining the prayer in succession before the meal.

- The anime includes an original scene at the end of the flashback to Frieren's conversation with Heiter, which consists of Stark catching Fern when she slips on the cabin roof while clearing the roof of snow with him.

- Stark and Fern shout out to Kraft in the distance after they part ways, and this is not included in the manga.

## [ARCS] Episode 12
**A Real Hero** ｢本 (ほん) 物 (もの) の勇 (ゆう) 者 (しゃ) , *Honmono no yūsha*?｣ is the twelfth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on November 24, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Deep in the mountains of the northern lands, Frieren and her party arrive at the Village of the Sword, where they have another job to do.

## Plot]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel the Hero's passing, Frieren's Party are in the Northern Lands, specifically, the Schwer Mountains. Stark and Fern travel a bit ahead, while Frieren has a hard time with the cold and falls asleep with a nose dive into the snow. Fern notices this and returns to pick her up. Stark offers to carry Frieren, but Fern shuts him down.

While being carried, Frieren has a flashback of the Hero Party, where she remembers their audience with the King and their subsequent departure to defeat the Demon King. Eisen was surprised at the mere ten copper coins granted by the King for their journey, and Heiter explained that many adventurers had unsuccessfully tried to defeat the Demon King. Himmel supposed that their lack of funds just means they have the opportunity to earn more on their journey, and he explained that it feels like they are going on a real adventure, to which Heiter agreed.

Himmel took out and admired his sword, and Frieren identified it as the "Sword of the Hero," but Heiter corrected her and clarified that the sword is just a replica. Himmel recalled the events leading to him receiving the sword: the sword was gifted to him as a token of gratitude by a merchant he saved from a monster, and the merchant described it as a sword for a hero. Frieren asked him if that was why he wanted to become a hero, but Himmel denied this, and he explained that he wanted to prove Heiter wrong, as when they were younger, Heiter told him that he would only become a fake hero with a fake sword. Therefore, he resolved to become a real hero and acquire the real Sword of the Hero and defeat the Demon King. As they continued traveling, Himmel joked that Heiter was a fake priest who only drank, and they all laugh and move on, except for Frieren, who is speechless and fascinated when Himmel turned back to her with a smile.

Back in the present, Frieren wakes up and instructs Fern, who is currently carrying her, to press forward, as she finds the current landscape familiar. She mentions that she underestimated the weather in the mountains, however, their destination—a village—should be nearby. Fern asks if Frieren can walk, but she refuses. Stark offers to carry her, but Fern rejects his offer and continues carrying Frieren until she eventually starts walking on her own. The snowstorm subsides, and the trio notice their destination in view as they pass by a broken-down building. When they reach the fortified village, they are welcomed to the Village of the Sword by its chief—a young girl who introduces herself as the 49th village chief.

While walking with the chief, Frieren asks what the destroyed building was, and the chief tells Frieren that it was a hunter's cabin in the past that was destroyed by the Lord of the Mountains. As Frieren tries to recall if there was a "Lord of the Mountains" in the past, Stark recognizes the name of the Village of the Sword, and Fern asks if he was aware of it. Stark explains that this village protects the "Sword of the Hero," a famous sword allegedly embedded by the Goddess of Creation, and it was said to have been extracted by Himmel eighty years prior, the first to do so since it was placed. The village chief recites the legend of the sword, which describes it as something that can only be pulled by the hero that drives out the great calamity. Fern clarifies that Himmel was the one who pulled out the sword, and Stark confirms. Stark is confused about how Fern does not know such a famous story, and Fern replies that Heiter never mentioned it to her.

Frieren's party accompany the village chief into a building, where Frieren sits by the fireplace to warm up. The chief recites the will of her grandmother, a past village chief, and she acts out her grandmother's anger towards Frieren given the elf was late on her promise to return half a century later to help protect the village. Frieren says that she expected it would be safe for 80 years, but the village chief stresses that she still has to fulfill her duty. Fern asks what the chief meant by duty, and Frieren tells her it is monster extermination. The chief explains that the "Ruler of the Mountains" has been troublesome, and Frieren decides they will start on the task the next day.

The next day, Frieren's party starts to defeat many wolf-like monsters, and the chief applauds their efforts. Fern asks why they did not issue a subjugation request to adventurers, and the chief replies that they could, but Frieren ends her reply with the statement that Himmel is the Hero, leaving Fern confused. Stark sees more monsters congregating at the entrance of a cave and proceeds to kill them. As he turns to talk to Frieren, he is pushed down by the Lord of the Mountains. The chief confirms that this monster is the Lord, and Frieren is unimpressed that, within eighty years, the monster would consider itself a Lord. She faces the creature and demands Stark to move if he still can. Stark complies and cuts the monster's arm off, which prompts the monster to take a swing at Frieren with its remaining claw, but Fern casts a spherical defense spell around herself and Frieren. Frieren praises her and then proceeds to exterminate the monster with a blast of offense magic.

Stark sits down in front of the cave entrance and confronts Frieren about what is inside it, which is the "Sword of the Hero," still embedded within a rock. She tells him that it was the reason that monsters are attracted by the cave, as they cannot resist the urge to destroy the blade even though the sanctuary is protected by a powerful barrier. Stark says that he did not mean the monsters, and Frieren, understanding his confusion, explains that Himmel could not pull the sword out as she recalls when the Hero's Party visited the same cave eighty years ago.

In Frieren's flashback, Himmel unsuccessfully retrieved the sword. The village chief at the time—the grandmother of the present one—remarked that he must not be a true hero either, as he failed alongside those that previously attempted to remove the sword. Heiter tried to console Himmel, but before he could, Himmel stated that it was fine if he was a fake hero. He reassured his determination to defeat the Demon King and bring peace, and as long as he is able to achieve this feat, it will not matter if he is a fake or real hero.

In the present, Frieren describes that Himmel was ultimately able to accomplish his goal, and even without the sword, he had proved that he could save the world and that he was a real hero. Fern asks why this was kept a secret, and Frieren replies that it was probably the doing of those who wanted Himmel to be the hero. She explains that unsavory anecdotes would be detrimental to his story, as heroes are glorified by future generations and their stories eventually become unrecognizable. Frieren, Fern, and the chief head back to the village, but Stark stays behind and contemplates their discussion. He looks at the Sword of the Hero stuck in the stone and has a sudden memory about a man with red hair standing in front of a burning house.

Later, Frieren's party prepares to continue on their journey. The village chief thanks them in a manner her grandmother would express and asks Frieren not to be late next time. Frieren's party subsequently departs from the village.

That same year, Frieren's party travels further in the Northern Lands and arrives at the Appetit Region. They reach a town and settle at an inn, deciding to relax for the rest of the day. Frieren chooses to read grimoires in her room and Fern prepares to head out to explore the shops on her own. Before Fern leaves, Frieren suddenly remembers that it is Stark's eighteenth birthday. Fern panics, as she has not arranged a gift for him. When Frieren suggests simply buying one while she shops, Fern mentions that she is unsure about what Stark likes. Frieren teases her for her uncertainty, which Fern blames on her.

Fern asks Frieren what she intends to gift him, and Frieren excitedly jumps out of bed to open her suitcase and says she planned something special. She holds up a potion and reveals that it is capable of dissolving clothes, and she smirks while saying her master told her that men would be very happy to receive such a gift. Fern is shocked and disgusted by the idea and takes the bottle out of Frieren's hand. Much to Frieren's dismay, Fern opens it and pours the contents onto her, melting her clothes, and Fern comments that this vulgar purchase should have been returned back when bought. She promptly leaves, slamming the door. A devastated Frieren grumbles that the drug was precious and wraps herself in a blanket. As she thinks about a new gift for Stark, she goes over the contents of her suitcase once more. Her attention falls on a ring, which she picks up and stares at for a moment. She then notices a slip of paper, which gives her an idea.

Fern chooses to investigate what to gift Stark, and upon discovering his empty room, she begins asking the townsfolk for help locating him. Multiple individuals recall encountering him after he had helped them with various tasks, such as a merchant lady whose cart he helped push, some kids he played with, a child with a cat he retrieved from a tree, and a cattle breeder whose cattle he helped round up. After hearing these stories of Stark being courteous, Fern reinforces her idea that Frieren was being inconsiderate for generalizing his personality. Right after, she discovers him on a bench. As she approaches him, he loudly points out vulgar cloud shapes to himself. This causes her to retreat to a house corner, and she realizes that Stark has childish thoughts. He comments out loud that he will tell Fern about his cloud discoveries, and Fern is unsure how to respond. Eventually, she resolves to approach him and addresses him from behind. He turns around and begins to tell her about the clouds but falls silent upon seeing Fern's facial expression.

Fern invites him on a walk, and as Stark asks her about why she was angry, she ignores him. She is unsure how to bring up his birthday and decides to ask directly. Surprised, he questions her if she would be gifting him something, but his words anger her and she tells him to forget about it. Stark plays his words off as a joke and reflects on how he has never received birthday gifts growing up, even from his family or his master, and he has come to accept this. He explains that after all, he was raised in a village full of warriors, and they did not value weaklings.

Stark thinks back to his childhood and recalls a scene where his father scolded a handful of warriors with blemished white cloaks and expressed that they should look up to Stark's brother, Stoltz, who stood uninjured in front of a defeated boar-like monster with his white cloak still pristine. Stark's father claimed that Stoltz is the strongest and the pride of the village, and as he walked by a young Stark training, he considered the boy a failure in comparison.

As it started raining, Stark's father headed home first, but Stoltz stayed behind to help his brother. As Stark practiced his sword technique, Stoltz took the initiative to train his younger brother and was patient with him, praising him for his concentration and giving him pointers on how to improve. In the present, Stark remembers Stoltz was the only individual who was like that with him. Stark recalls another memory, where a demon that had attacked the village had a standoff against the village's warriors. Upon realizing the gravity of the situation, the young Stark turned away and fled the attack. 

After thinking back to his past, Stark remarks that he abandoned Stoltz and fled during the demon's attack. He blames himself for running and thinks that his family was right to never have celebrated his birthday. Stark then remembers the Sword of the Hero and mentions that Himmel would not run away in the same circumstances.

After hearing Stark's story, Fern tells him that he should go with her to pick a present and not concern himself with his past, as she only knows the Stark that has fought back and never fled. Stark reminds her that he may flee in the future, but Fern rebutes him and tells him that she and Frieren will not let him do so. She says she will pick out his present on her own if he does not come along with her, and after he reluctantly agrees, they spend time in the shops choosing his present. Stark ends up picking a silver bracelet, and the two of them return back to the inn, with Stark sporting the bracelet.

Frieren welcomes them back and tells them they are late as she serves giant hamburger steaks, fried over an open fire. Fern questions her intentions, but before Frieren replies, Stark says that this is how birthdays are celebrated. Stark mentions that despite never receiving presents from Eisen, his master would always make him these steaks for his birthday. Frieren asks if Eisen has ever told Stark the idea behind it and remarks that warriors are awkward, and given that she is too, she understands Eisen's point of view. Frieren tells Stark that those who are awkward cannot properly express their thoughts unless they are put into words.

Frieren refers back to a time the Hero Party was camping at night, and Eisen was busy with frying massive hamburger steaks on a grill. When Frieren asked why he would cook these steaks on their birthdays, the dwarf explains that it was a regional custom to thank warriors for their hard work. Himmel commented that the Hero Party's members aren't warriors, but Eisen replied that he defined a warrior as anyone who puts in their best effort. Stark muses over Frieren's explanation and Eisen's statement, and he thinks back to one of his birthdays, where Stoltz had also secretly made a hamburger steak for him. He then remembers the night of the demon attack, where Stoltz had instructed him to escape and live. Frieren cites Eisen for the steak recipe and asks about its taste, and Stark replies that he enjoys it.

After their meal, Frieren reveals the potion that dissolves clothes and points out there is a little left. An upset Fern replies that she will pour the remainder onto Frieren's head again. The curious Stark then asks what the potion was, but he receives a flat reply from Fern, who calls him a pervert.

## [ARCS] Episode 13
**Aversion to One's Own Kind** ｢同 (どう) 族 (ぞく) 嫌 (けん) 悪 (お) , *Dōzoku ken'o*?｣ is the thirteenth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on December 1, 2023.

## Synopsis]

While passing by a village in the woods of the northern lands, Frieren and party meet Sein, a gifted priest who is nonetheless corrupt enough to give even Heiter a run for his money. But what happened in his past? 

## Plot]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel the Hero's passing, Frieren's Party arrives at the Alt Woods in the Northern Lands. Frieren goes to gather herbs alone and encounters a man. She introduces herself as an adventurer, and the man tells her his backstory, as he wanted to become an adventurer himself a long time ago. However, he now recognizes that he was simply following a childish dream. 

The man remembers how during his childhood, he had a good friend, an energetic boy that had the mannerisms of a gorilla. His friend was a caring individual, and they would frequently join each other on little adventurers, such as climbing a large tree together. However, after the man became a young adult, he slowly started to forget his dream. His friend invited him to become adventurers together, but he rejected his offer. Now, a decade later, the man acknowledges that he regrets his decision and thinks about how things would have been different if he had taken his friend's hand.

Frieren asks why he would tell her such a story, and the man states that since the harvest festival of his village is arriving, he was tasked by his older brother to gather herbs. However, he got stuck in a bottomless swamp and is now slowly sinking in, and he thinks he is done for. As he continues sinking, he reaches out with his hand and desperately tries to convince Frieren to help him. Frieren requests for more time to think about it, and she ultimately refuses, as the man's hand is dirty from being covered in mud. As she tries to recall a spell to pull someone out of a bottomless swamp, Fern arrives to check on Frieren. Frieren ends up remembering the spell, and she frees the man.

After reuniting with Stark, Frieren's party accompanies the man to his village. Fern apologizes for the trouble Frieren caused and states that she will scold her. As an expression of gratitude, the man invites Frieren's party to his village, but they decline as they need to replenish their supplies and prefer to reach a major town by the end of the day. He understands and warns them of dangerously venomous creatures. Stark confirms with enthusiasm that he heard his advice. However, shortly after they part ways with the man, Stark gets bitten in the arm by a venomous snake while looking at berries on a bush. Fern is stunned and voices her disappointment, but her irritation is diverted when Stark's nose starts bleeding.

Frieren applies a spell that identifies poison, but she is unable to analyze it properly since she is not a priest. As she cannot recognize the reaction, the party decides to get him diagnosed in a church. Fern confirms that they do not have not enough mana to fly to the next town, so they decide to head back to the previous village. Stark initially refuses, as he thinks he can tough the poison out like his master. Frieren recalls that Eisen was indeed unfazed after he was struck with three arrows coated with poison strong enough to knock out a dragon, appalling Heiter, but Fern thinks Eisen's constitution is just out of the ordinary. Heiter had once told her that twenty percent of adventurers would die by poison, so Fern urges them to head back by utilizing flying magic.

Frieren's party arrives at the village's church, where they meet the church father, the village's local priest. He chillingly states that it is too late for Stark as the snake bite would only be treatable during the initial stage. However, he considers that perhaps his younger brother might be able to cure him. At that moment, the man from before, named Sein, enters the church's main hall to talk to his elder brother, the village's priest, and recognizes Frieren's party. He promptly and effortlessly treats Stark by putting a hand on his shoulder and applying detoxification magic before leaving to help at the plaza.

When the church father asks Frieren what she thinks of Sein, Frieren points out the Holy Symbol emblem around the neck of the church father, which she mentions is only granted to the very best priest of a region by the Holy City. Frieren notes that Sein is a healing expert who has outstanding talent, as he could instantly cure a poison that even the superior priest of the region deemed incurable, which would make him a genius. The village priest says he knows about Frieren because Heiter told stories when he came to the village to award the emblem, but he does not compare himself to his younger brother. He tells her that their parents passed away early and that he took care of Sein. Although Sein used to tell his brother about how he wanted to become an adventurer, he changed when he became an adult. Sein's elder brother then asks Frieren to take him away from the village, as he believes Sein has been searching for someone to push him to revitalize his dream.

Back at the inn, both Stark and Fern are in favor of Sein's brother's proposal, as it would be beneficial to have a priest in the party. Frieren is uneasy, stating cryptically that she has an aversion against her own kind. Stark does not understand her reasoning, but he nonetheless sets out to recruit Sein, leaving Fern and Frieren to go downstairs and visit the bar where Sein spends time. He finds Sein playing a card game with two other men while also drinking and smoking at the tavern. Stark comments on the situation looking corrupt, however, Sein says it is a way to get to know people. He invites the boy to have a seat and take part in the game. If he wins the gambling match, Sein promises to join the party.

Stark's scream interrupts Fern's reading in bed upstairs. She wakes up Frieren and both rush to ascertain Stark's situation. The mages find the young man stripped bare down to his underwear wailing outside the tavern. Fern states that the situation looks terrible and is surprised that not only are all of Stark's belongings missing, but Sein, who is sitting against a wall smoking, has also been stripped after losing all his belongings. Sein explains that the village chief beat both of them, and he asks the party to not judge him, as all adults are dirty. When Frieren asks Sein to join their party, Sein tells Frieren to find someone else, as he thinks it is too late for him to pursue the path of an adventurer.

Sein's remarks remind Frieren of when Himmel first set out to recruit her. In a flashback, Himmel, accompanied by Eisen and Heiter, invites Frieren to defeat the Demon King as part of the Hero Party. She states that she has not fought a demon in over five hundred years, so she has forgotten how to do so. She believes that she must have been afraid and deferred the decision for too long to fight the Demon King, and now that enough years have passed, it is already too late. Himmel tells Frieren that he is talking about the present, which she recites verbatim to Sein.

Upon hearing this, Sein is briefly reminded of his childhood friend, but he still refuses and tells Frieren that she could not understand his feelings. Frieren rebutes him and says that his response tells her everything she needs to know, and since she does not like him, she has unwaveringly decided to make him a party member no matter what. Sein fails to understand this logic and expresses that he is scared by the conviction Frieren demonstrates.

Shortly after the conversation between Sein and Frieren, Fern goes to retrieve Stark and Sein's belongings. She visits the village chief and apologizes for the trouble the men caused him, however, the chief returns all of the men's belongings for free and wishes her a nice stay during the village's harvest festival. Fern returns Stark and Sein's belongings, but not without an expression of her disdain towards both of them. After Fern leaves, Sein questions what made her so upset, and Frieren explains that Fern did not like how Stark got stripped of all his belongings.

Back at the inn, Fern complains about how awful she finds gamblers, especially Sein, as he is a priest. Frieren remarks that she is unsure about priests that drink, but Fern states alcohol is the best medicine, which makes Frieren think that Heiter gave Fern awful teachings. Frieren returns to discussing Sein and says that whether or not they make Sein an ally, she still wants to support him on his journey to become an adventurer, as that is what Himmel would have done.

Frieren's party stays in the village over the next few days and tries to recruit Sein every day. Sein remarks that Frieren's eyes seem similar to his old friend's, which were filled with hopes and dreams, as she unrelentingly pushes him to go on an adventure with her party. He remembers a scene from the past where his childhood friend told him he will go explore the Northern Lands and that he will return for the next harvest festival in three years. He told Sein that he can decide then if he wanted to go on an adventure with him.

After many failed attempts to recruit Sein, Frieren's party goes to the church and consults Sein's older brother about what Sein likes. He tells them about the priests fondness for alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. This prompts Fern to say that Heiter was a serious priest after all, but Frieren disagrees. Sein's brother says Sein is also interested in older women, which gives Frieren's party an idea. Sein later comes in and has a small conversation with the brother, and as he leaves the church, Stark goes after him. He talks to Sein outside and asks if he wants to travel with an older lady. Sein answers becoming an adventurer when he was a kid was just for that.

When Sein asks where the older lady is, Frieren reveals herself, saying that as an elf, she is a much older lady. However, Sein is distressed by the thought and states that Frieren could not be considered a lady. Frieren then tries to seduce him by blowing him a kiss, a seduction technique she learned from her master, but it has no effect on Sein, and he instead considers it childish. Fern and Stark, however, are embarrassed by Frieren's action, which makes Sein unimpressed. Frieren is disappointed by this outcome, as she recalls that she was able to make Himmel faint when she tried it on him, earning her a stinging remark by Eisen. The elf finds it strange that Sein is not affected, and Stark supposes that Sein is a still a priest despite how corrupt he is.

Sein tells Frieren that she should stop now, as he has no intention of becoming an adventurer. Frieren asks why he does not want to track down his best friend, and Sein addresses his brother, saying he would understand him. Sein tells her that his childhood friend said he would return in three years, but it has been ten years since, so he must already be dead. Frieren points out that Sein is giving up before he has even gone to pursue him and it has only been a mere ten years. She adds that if Sein does not go now, he would regret it in the future. As Sein asks why he should go now, Frieren restates that she is talking about the present. This statement seems to move Sein, but he still refuses, saying that the reason why he refuses to leave the village is the same as ten years ago: he cannot abandon his older brother.

When his brother asks what he means, Sein shares that when he was younger, he overheard a conversation between his brother and Heiter when the bishop came to visit. Sein heard Heiter tell his elder brother that with his talent, he could serve as a priest at the Holy City, and Sein could come with him. However, Sein's elder brother declined and stated that he was content living in the village and that he cannot take Sein's hometown away from him, as the boy had already lost his parents at a very young age. Heiter accepted his decision and decided that since he came to the village anyways, he might as well tell Sein about some of his adventures.

In the present, Sein concludes that his older brother stayed behind in the village for his sake. Sein's brother, upon hearing this, becomes angry and slaps Sein. He tells him that they are not the same, as he has not once regretted the decision he made. He asks Sein how long he is planning to drown himself in regret, leaving Sein to mull over his words.

Later that day, while Frieren's party are at a river, Sein approaches them and reveals that he apologized to his older brother. He tells Frieren that it is the first time his brother has ever raised a hand on him, and it also was the first time he saw such an expression from him. Sein announces to Frieren that he has decided to become an adventurer to pursue his friend, as after all, it has only been a mere ten years since he left. Sein explains that he wants to make his childhood dream come true and states that he will travel with Frieren's party partway until he finds his old friend.

Frieren's party prepare to depart the village, now with Sein added as a party member, and they bid farewell to the villagers. Sein asks what the destination of their journey is, and Frieren replies Heaven. Sein says that anyone could go there by dying, but Fern retorts that she wonders if even Sein could go there as well. Sein is baffled about Fern's straightforwardness, and Stark consoles him.

## Synopsis]

The party arrives in a large and lively town with a bustling shopping district that Frieren once visited with Himmel, but something seems to have come up between Fern and Stark.

## Plot]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's passing, Frieren's Party arrives at the Raad Region in the Northern Lands, where they visit a lively town filled with shops. Frieren recognizes the town as one the Hero Party had visited before, and she briefly recalls their experience, which includes Heiter delight towards the abundance of bars and Himmel's invitation to go shopping with Frieren. In the present, she looks at a clock tower in the distance. Stark calls out to her, and she goes to catch up with the rest of her party.

In an inn, Stark tearfully exclaims that Fern is too critical to him. He tells Frieren and Fern that he has had enough and loudly proclaims that he is returning to his master, slamming the door on his way out. In the hallway, Sein watches him angrily leave while complaining about Fern. Frieren follows Stark out the door and encounters Sein, who has only witnessed the aftermath of the argument and asks if Stark and Fern are having a lovers' quarrel. Frieren sits with a sulking Fern on the bed and explains that today is Fern's birthday, but Stark failed to prepare a present for her. Frieren believes that Fern went overboard, as she refused to listen to anything Stark said. Sein inputs that he too has no gift for Fern, as men typically do not make a big deal out of anniversaries like birthdays. Fern's anger erupts and she stands up to kick Sein's shins, causing Sein to say he will go buy Fern a gift. As he lights a cigarette, Sein expresses that he feels sorry for Stark and tells Fern that for a boy of Stark's age, dealing with girls is hard and can affect him emotionally. When Sein heads out, he advises Fern that she should pursue Stark. Fern is further urged to do so by Frieren, and after she contemplates the idea, Fern heads out.

Stark sits despondently at the base of a statue of Himmel and looks at his bracelet. Fern finds him and watches him from behind a building, uncertain about what to do. Meanwhile, Sein searches for a present for Fern and sets his eyes on a pouch with a butterfly design from a vendor, noting that Fern also has a butterfly hair ornament. Fern approaches him and comments that she finds the pouch cute. Sein wonders if the pouch is not to Fern's taste, but Fern refutes him and claims that she finds the pouch unpleasant as it gives the impression that Sein is experienced with women.

Sein then asks Fern if she managed to find Stark. Fern states that she saw him at the plaza, but she does not finish her statement, leading Sein to deduce that Fern was unable to talk to him. He notes that her youth makes her incapable of handling boys the same age as her, but he can see that she does not actually hate Stark. He requests that Fern pick whichever item she wants for her gift or choose a different store. Fern smiles and tells him it is alright, prompting him to say that he will choose something then. As he continues looking, Sein advises Fern that even if Stark failed to prepare her a gift, he still thinks she was too hard on him, as Stark is not the most aware guy and probably does not even remember his own birthday. Fern explains that she gave Stark a present on his birthday, but Sein calls her out on the fact that he picked something out with her together for him. Fern is surprised that Sein was able to figure that out, but Sein tells her that it is rare for people to reject an offer to pick whatever present they would like. After this, he grabs the pouch with the butterfly motif and buys it from the shop owner. He hands the gift to Fern and encourages her to make up with Stark by vocalizing her thoughts and properly express them to him.

Fern approaches Stark, who is still at the plaza, and Stark apologizes to Fern before she can voice her words. He explains that he wanted to find something together, but he was unsure if she would like the idea. Fern tells him she would not be upset with him for proposing the idea and apologizes in return for treating him harshly. They reconcile and walk down the street to explore the town.

Frieren watches Fern and Stark from a rooftop, and she is soon joined by Sein. He tells her that she should not be spying on Fern and Stark, but Frieren reminds him that he is doing the same. Sein comments that the two have managed to make up, and he expresses that Fern and Stark being able to argue is a privilege only young individuals can experience, as adults would have learned to avoid conflicts of this nature. He tells Frieren that she has it rough dealing with the two kids, but Frieren struggles to comprehend what he means about understanding relationships, which causes Sein retort that Frieren must also be a kid. Sein tells Frieren that Fern came to him to ask for advice, and he wonders who she is comparing him to. Frieren explains that Heiter was the one who raised Fern, and Sein is uncertain about being compared to a man he holds in such high regard. Frieren cites Heiter's unpleasant sides and points out that Heiter was a corrupt priest, but Sein views him as the ideal adult.

Frieren thinks back to Heiter's last years, when she was with him and Fern. She said to Heiter that he had matured, and he acknowledged that he had grown old. However, Heiter felt that his mind had barely changed since he was a child and that instead of him being an actual adult, he just pretended to be one, and he had to do so to provide emotional support to Fern as a good role model. After Heiter said that children need praise, Frieren asked who would praise Heiter for his efforts. He mentioned that the Goddess would do so when he gets to Heaven, but Frieren remarked that she will praise him now and started patting him on the head. Heiter expressed the pleasantness of her action, and he told her that when he sees the Goddess, he will ask her to also praise Frieren.

Back in the present, Frieren starts patting Sein's head. He asks her what her intention is, and she tells him that he is doing a good job as an adult. Sein voices his disappointment, as he would have appreciated an older women comforting him instead. Meanwhile, Stark and Fern browse the streets of the town as Stark tries to find a present for Fern.

After leaving the Rohr Road town, Frieren's party catches a ride on a horse-drawn carriage that moves through the Bande Woods in the Northern Lands. Frieren thanks the driver for taking them along, as wagons are not common in the area. The driver reveals that he is a merchant who runs an accessories shop, and he asks if the party would be interested in checking out his goods. Frieren responds that he is a good salesman, but she is not interested. As she asks if Fern would be interested, Frieren notices Fern wearing a new bracelet. Frieren compliments the design and mentions that she had once been gifted a ring from Himmel that has the same design.

Frieren begins digging through her suitcase in search of the ring, but she is unable to find it due to the unkempt state of her luggage, which Fern chastises her for. She finally finds the ring, however, immediately after, the wagon is lifted into the air by an enormous aerial monster.

Frieren apologizes for letting down her guard and not detecting the monster earlier, and she comments on the ability of bird monsters to cunningly mask their mana. Stark suggests that they fight the bird and use flying magic to land the wagon, but Frieren asks if he has ever seen a flying carriage before and points out that humans have only recently been able to fly in the last forty years by copying flying magic from demons. Thus, mankind's version of flying magic cannot be used freely, as its principles are still unknown, and objects larger than humans can only be made to fly for a short period of time, which is not enough for them to safely land. With their options limited, Frieren proposes they simply escape by flying. Fern is asked to take Sein while she herself takes the merchant.

Stark asks what he is supposed to do, and Frieren tells him to jump down, but Stark reminds her that he will fall to his death. Frieren comments that he, as a warrior, would not die from falling from that height, with which Stark vehemently disagrees. Frieren recalls how Eisen could fall from any height without sustaining any injuries, shocking Heiter, but Fern reminds Frieren that this only shows how far from normal Eisen was. Fern suggests making the wagon float right before it hits the ground. Frieren calculates if they can cancel out their fall, as they must break the momentum or the wagon would be crushed, much to Stark's dismay.

Sein points out that they should make their decision soon, as the bird monster hunts its prey by slamming it into the ground. Frieren agrees and immediately heads out to cast an offensive spell at the monster, decapitating it. Subsequently, the wagon begins falling freely, and Stark screams at Frieren to not make them suddenly drop. They crash into the ground, but everyone, including the horse, manages to survive the fall without any prominent injuries. Sein uses Goddess's magic to heal the horse, and Frieren apologizes to the merchant for getting them into the situation. However, he tells her not to worry and instead thanks her, as he would have died if he had been traveling alone.

The next day, the group begins repairs on the carriage. As Frieren goes through her luggage, she realizes her ring from Himmel is missing. Meanwhile, Fern, Stark and Sein gather supplies. They talk about the warmer weather, during which Sein notices Fern's bracelet, which Fern reveals is a birthday gift from Stark. Stark laments how it took him three hours to choose. Sein confirms that Stark personally picked out the bracelet and comforts him about how difficult of a situation he must have been in. Stark agrees and complains about how he had to try and read Fern's face for three hours as he picked out her present. Nevertheless, he expresses relief that she ended up happily accepting the gift.

Sein compliments Stark's nature, as he had expected him to be much less charming. With Sein's knowledge about the language of flowers, he reveals to Stark that the mirrored-lotus flower on the bracelet's design means "eternal love," and in this region, such a gift is given by people to their lovers. Fern overhears this and Stark asserts to her that he was not aware of its meaning. He exclaims that he has no knowledge of the language of flowers and that everything was a misunderstanding, causing Fern to bitterly call him an idiot. He points out that Fern was unaware of the meaning too and asks if she would like a different gift instead. Fern rejects the idea, given the amount of effort Stark had put into finding the gift, and she tells him never to bring up such a suggestion again. As Stark apologizes, Sein is amused, and the three of them head back to the camp.

The group camp out over the next few days as they fix the wagon. Every night, Frieren leaves the campsite to search for something, which Fern picks up on. On their last night, Fern follows Frieren. She asks what Frieren is looking for, and the elf mentions the ring that Himmel gave her was missing. Fern offers to aid in the search and tells her that they can delay their departure. Frieren explains that she is used to losing things and Himmel has given her other gifts, so she will give up on searching if she cannot find it that night. Fern points out that if the ring has the same design as her bracelet, it must also mean "eternal love" in the language of flowers. Frieren discloses that she was not aware, and she doubts was Himmel was aware as well. However, Fern expresses that it must be important to her.

After learning about Frieren's missing ring, the merchant says that they should have told him and explains that a few people lost accessories over the years, so he has a spell that finds lost accessories. He mentions that he intended to gift Frieren the spell as a reward for her assistance, and Frieren gladly accepts it. Frieren then flies into the night sky and casts the spell. While doing so, she thinks back to when Himmel rewarded her for her hard work in one of their side quests by letting her pick out something from an accessory stand. She promptly picked out a ring without much thought, and upon seeing her choice, Himmel longingly smiled and thanked the vendor. 

Back in the present, Frieren is able to detect the ring after using the spell, which causes the ring to emit a column of light from within the forest. As she goes to retrieve it, Frieren is reminded of another memory, where she walked alongside Himmel towards the clock tower in the Raad Region's town after they purchased the ring. Himmel called out to Frieren and gave her the ring by kneeling down and sliding it onto her ring finger. The flashback ends with him smiling blissfully as Frieren stands, confused.

With the carriage fixed, the group continues their journey through the forest. Fern mentions that Frieren must be glad to have her lost ring back, and Frieren happily reflects on her memories. She then turns the interest to Fern and asks why she wears a bracelet with a mirrored-lotus motif. This prompts Fern to call Stark an idiot, which causes Stark to mope.

## Episode Notes]

- At the start of the episode, Frieren's Party is shown going through town. While doing so, Frieren recalls the Hero Party's previous visit to the same town, and she looks at a clocktower in the distance. This scene is original to the anime, and it relates to the end of the episode, where Frieren has a memory of Himmel kneeling and sliding the ring with the mirrored-lotus flower motif onto her finger in front of the clocktower.

- In the anime, when Frieren and Sein end their talk on the roof, a scene of Stark gauging Fern's reactions to potential birthday presents follows. In the manga, this scene occurs as a flashback instead in Chapter 31.

- When Frieren explains that flying magic is relatively new to humans, she pictures a demon flying in the air in both the manga and the anime. However, the anime also includes the scenes of Frieren flying to the top of the tower with the blue-moon weed in Episode 3 and Fern carrying Frieren while flying in Episode 4 to illustrate this.

- In the manga, the memory Frieren has when describing Eisen's sturdiness simply depicts the dwarf in an impact crater. The anime extends this scene and includes Eisen diving head first off a cliff and forming the crater upon hitting the ground.

- In the anime, after Frieren kills the aerial monster and the wagon subsequently crash-lands, she states that she considers their plan a success, which evokes comments from Stark and Sein that are not included in the manga.

- In Crunchyroll's English subtitled release of this episode of the anime, the scene in which Himmel gifts Frieren the ring mistakenly has Himmel say that the ring is a reward for Frieren's hard work towards defeating the now-deceased Demon King. This would imply that the scene occurs after the defeat of the Demon King. The original Japanese voice line has no mention of the Demon King, and the English subtitles were later fixed to reflect the correct line. The subtitles now correctly state that Himmel wanted to reward Frieren for a good job on a side quest, which is the same line used in the manga.

## [ARCS] Episode 15
**Smells like Trouble** ｢厄 (やっ) 介 (かい) 事 (ごと) の匂 (にお) い, *Yakkaigoto no nioi*?｣ is the fifteenth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on December 15, 2023.

## Synopsis]

When the party happens upon a town whose inhabitants are all mysteriously asleep, it's time for their newest traveling companion to prove his mettle.

## Plot]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's passing, Frieren's Party ride a cart through the Laub Hills in the Northern Lands. Frieren reads a book while Fern dozes off. Sein asks how long they have all been traveling together, and Fern tells him she went on the journey with Frieren more than four years ago, with Stark adding in that he has been around for about a year. Sein smiles upon hearing the answers.

Later, Frieren's party continues towards the next village on foot. Sein suddenly remarks that something is missing from their group, which prompts Frieren to list the classes the party currently has. Fern suggests that a thief may be a useful addition, as Frieren always falls for mimic traps. Sein stops and proclaims that most importantly, the party lacks an older woman, and he loudly expresses his belief that every party should have at least one mature lady. Stark points out that Frieren is indeed an older woman, but Sein quickly dismisses the notion. Stark attempts to steer the conversation away from the uncomfortable topic by mentioning that they are approaching the next village.

As they arrive in the village, they are met with a peculiar sight: all the humans appear to be asleep. Fern points out that they are still breathing and Sein confirms this. Stark questions what is going on, and Frieren suggests they leave for the next village to avoid any trouble. Fern chastises Frieren for the suggestion, and Frieren clarifies that she was joking. Sein continues to examine the villagers and deduces that a curse has been cast upon them, which Frieren concurs. Stark asks Frieren for clarification, and she explains that a curse is a spell employed by monsters and demons that could petrify or put people to sleep, and humanity has not yet unraveled them. She adds that they have yet to discover a way to break curses, causing Stark to fear that the village is doomed. Frieren reassures him that there is still hope, as while humanity's magic can not solve it, the Goddesses' magic used by priests is different. She adds that, for a long time, the role of priests is to counter curses.

As Sein works to determine the nature of the curse, the rest of the party enters a building. Stark asks what makes Goddess's magic different from other types of magic, and Frieren explains that the magic is recorded in Holy Scriptures, and only those in possession of these scriptures can use it. Frieren adds that the principles of Goddess's magic are barely understood, much like the magic of demons, and therefore it does not appeal to her. She also notes that the magic is difficult to handle unless one has the "Blessing of The Goddess," which makes one more resistant to curses, giving priests an advantage. Stark asks if even Frieren has a hard time defending against curses, to which she replies that mages cannot detect curses, although she can sense that she is being attacked in some way. Fern voices that she feels anxious, and Stark fearfully wonders if they are being actively cursed.

Sein finishes his examination and proclaims that the curse is rather unique. He suggests that they strike at the source of the curse, otherwise, he would need special equipment, and it would be quicker to deal with the source directly, as he has already determined the location of the monster casting the curse. As soon as they start walking, Stark falls victim to the curse. Frieren asks if Sein can lift the curse temporarily, to which he replies that he can only keep him awake for five seconds. The priest then urges everyone to hurry.

With no other option, they set off towards the monster while carrying Stark with floating magic. Along the way, they make a campfire, and Fern also falls asleep while she rests. Frieren comments that the situation is bad, and Sein and Frieren decide to leave them as they continue looking for the monster. Frieren casts a magical barrier for protection around Fern and Stark, and she and Sein set off towards the monster. When Sein says they are close to it, Frieren tells him to wake her up when the monster appears. As she subsequently starts falling asleep, she warns Sein not to fight the monster alone and that she promises to defeat it. Sein doubts her to do so in the small time he can awaken her. He carries Frieren on his back for the remaining distance between them and the monster, and he says to himself that he also knows offensive magic.

As he arrives at the location of the monster, he sets down Frieren against a tree. As he confronts the flower-like monster, he notes that it is a subspecies of a Chaos Flower, a monster that puts people to sleep and slowly drains their mana, killing them and later using them as fertilizer. Sein thinks about the weak point of all Chaos Flowers and launches a spell—Three Spears of the Goddess—towards the creature's core.

To Sein's surprise, his spell is deflected by the mirror-like leaves of the flower. He realizes that if he cannot strike directly at the core, the creature's leaves will reflect his spells and damage the surrounding areas. He considers waking up Frieren, but he quickly dismisses the idea: as a member of the Hero Party, Frieren's spells are too powerful to risk being deflected and potentially devastate the village they are trying to save. He argues to himself that even if he were to awaken her, they have not yet established mutual understanding with each other and within the five seconds, he does not know if he can communicate where to strike the monster.

However, Sein suddenly recalls a memory of Heiter telling him and his childhood friend about the adventures of the Hero Party. Heiter believes that adventurers like them did not need trust or mutual understanding, as Frieren was terrible at communicating properly. All they needed was to believe in each others' words, and since Frieren proclaimed to defeat the Demon King no matter what, he chose to believe and trust her. Sein recalls Frieren's words to not fight the monster alone and her promise to defeat it, so he decides to believe in her. Using an awakening spell, he manages to rouse Frieren. The mage gets up, and before Sein manages to finish telling her where to aim, she blasts an offensive spell at the weak point of the monster with ease. With the monster dead, Stark wakes up besides a still-asleep Fern, and he wonders what is going on.

Back in the village, the chief, an older woman, thanks Sein. Sein modestly insists that he did not do anything special. The chief gratefully states that the villagers could not have asked for a better way to be reawakened. Sein gleefully smiles as he continues the journey with the rest of the party. Frieren thanks him for his trust and tells him that the moment she woke up, she knew the monster was the type that could reflect spells. Sein calls her incredible, to which she replies that it was thanks to him that they managed to get out alive. She shows her pride in him by patting him on the head. Sein cannot help but think of the beautiful, older villager lady who had thanked him and again bemoans the lack of one in their party.

Frieren's party continues traveling further and reaches the Fortress city of Vorig. The party views the city from a distance, and Frieren starts to explain that Vorig is a relay point to Äußerst, and Fern comments that they are finally halfway there. Frieren suggests they resupply in Vorig, but Fern interrupts her and makes her aware of the party's lack of funds. At that moment, a man calls out to them. He approaches the group from his carriage, accompanied by a servant, and takes a good look at Stark. The nobleman comments on his nice body and that his appearance isn't bad either, prompting him to request they visit him in his mansion. 

Later, the nobleman sits together with Frieren's party in the mansion. The man asks for Stark's name and the boy answers. Frieren calls the man by name, Lord Orden, and tells him that this is the estate of the Orden family, one of the Three Great Knightly Houses of the Northern Lands. Frieren thinks of his grandfather, a previous lord, as a similarly pushy individual, which Orden dismisses as nonsense and expresses that he wants to converse more with Stark. Frieren interrupts again and says Stark is the warrior of their party. The nobleman brushes Frieren off and addresses Stark, telling him he has a request and that he would pay for it. Displeased, Frieren announces that they are leaving. Fern interrupts and shows Frieren their lack of travel funds. Seeing this, Frieren suggests that they hear what Lord Orden has to say.

Lord Orden asks about Stark's hometown, and Stark tells him he is from a village in the Klee Region in the Central Lands. Orden mentions that his family line also originated from that village. They gather in front of a large portrait, and Orden explains that it shows his eldest son, Wirt. Fern comments that Stark and him look alike, and Orden agrees. Frieren asks what this has to do with Orden's request. The nobleman explains that a month before, they fought a large battle against demons, and Wirt sacrificed himself to take down the enemy's general. He recalls the memory of his last moments with Wirt, and he reveals to Frieren's party that only his butler, Gabel, and some of their nearest confidants are aware of Wirt's death. 

Frieren asks how Stark would fit into the picture. Orden explains that Vorig is the key to the region's defense and he cannot allow morale to fall. There will be a social gathering of influential figures within the region in three months, and Stark would show up as Wirt's replacement. Frieren asks what the pay would be, and Orden offers ten Strahl gold coins. Fern whispers to the elf that this payment is enough for three meals a day and snacks for a year. Frieren wants a grimoire added to their reward, and Orden accepts the extra condition. Stark presents his scar on the face as a problem, but Orden is of the opinion that the people think Wirt is currently in recovery, and a battle scar would be something honorable. Fern then reaffirms that they need the money and Stark, in low spirits, agrees. After reaching an agreement, Orden orders Gabel to teach Stark proper etiquette.

Two of the three months until the event pass as Stark studies etiquette. He is trained on how to ride horses and dance, and he receives general education. Meanwhile, the other members enjoy their free time. Fern meets Stark in one of the estate's hallways and tells him his training appears to be taking a toll on him. When she about his progress, the young man kneels, takes her hand, looks up at her, and asks in return what she thinks. Fern replies that his behavior does not suit him. Stark then stands up and wanders off, leaving Fern alone, and she looks at the hand he had taken.

Lord Orden stands in thought in front of the portrait of Wirt, and Stark meets him, addressing him as "Lord Orden." The nobleman reminds him to say "father" in his presence, as there could always be somebody watching. Stark tells him that he thinks this is too cold considering how recently his son passed, but Orden says that it would have been his son's final wish. Orden admits to not enjoying the plan either but requests for Stark's cooperation. Stark and Orden walk outside into the backyard, where they come across a young boy who is practicing with a sword. Orden introduces him to Stark as his second son, Mut. Orden gives the child strict advice and says to Stark that his heir shows little improvement. Stark immediately recalls memories of his past about his father in the presence of Stoltz, regarding him as a failure.

While the nobleman gives Stark training in the family's technique, Stark asks what Orden thinks of his young son. Orden describes Mut as someone who may not have as much talent as brother, but as he works hard over time, he will grow to someone that could surpass himself. Stark feels relieved and tells him he should explicitly communicate this to his son as encouragement for the boy. Orden states that he already has, but it has seemingly gone to his head and Mut lacks improvement as a result. Stark playfully acknowledges that this is a problem.

Later, Frieren, Fern, and Lord Orden meet at tea time, where Orden reveals that Fern should also learn etiquette, shocking her. Orden points out that the event is a social gathering and asks if a young man is expected to attend it alone. He asks Frieren if she would prefer to escort him instead like a mother, but Frieren passes the duty off to Fern, wishing her good luck. Fern subsequently goes through the same training by the female staff in etiquette and dance while Sein and Frieren continue enjoying leisurely activities. 

Another month passes, and the evening of the social gathering begins. The ballroom comprises of various noble figures, alongside Frieren's party and Lord Orden. Fern sits in a dress while Stark stands beside her in uniform. The young woman comments that the past month was hellish, and Stark reminds her of her own words that they needed the money. Stark kneels, takes Fern's hand, and requests a dance, as they had practiced for it anyway. She tells him once again that this behavior does not suit him, but she reluctantly follows him to the dance floor. Alongside the other pairs in the ballroom, they dance to music while executing their choreography. They soon get into the dance and appear to enjoy the ambience, and Lord Orden and other guests watch them and appear to be taken in. Frieren sits at a table accompanied by Sein. He asks the elf if she would like to dance too, but Frieren focuses on eating cake and refuses.

Lord Orden takes a break in an empty side room and is accompanied by Gabel. He blames his eye injury for not being in the front lines, which may have changed Wirt's fate. As the butler tries to cheer him up, Stark arrives, and Orden confirms that the ball is coming to an end, which means Stark has fulfilled his duty. The Lord commands Gabel to reward Frieren and sends him out. Orden compliments Stark for being a powerful warrior and implies that he could stay here, but the young man declines the offer, as he is not a replacement for his son. The nobleman agrees and says he cannot be a replacement for Stark's father, either. Disappointed, Orden then reveals that he had an argument with Wirt and said something he didn't mean, leading him to part with Wirt in anger right before his death, and he recalls the day in his memory. He expresses his belief that him finding Stark was a miracle. However, for Stark, who recalls Eisen's face, explains that this is just one more reason he cannot stay, as he also said something he didn't mean with the man that raised him, and he wants to bring him stories of his travels. Reinvigorated, Lord Orden accepts the decision.

After the social gathering concludes, Frieren spends half a day looking through grimoires, struggling to choose one. An exhausted Gabel watches over her, and Fern urges Frieren to pick one and not distress the butler even further. Meanwhile, Stark stands with Sein near a window and watches the backyard. Sein remarks that it will take time before the city can rebuild the forces. Stark, however, is just pleased to see Orden training together with Mut, and he comments that Orden does not have to worry about his heir at least.

## Episode Notes]

- The anime has an extra scene at the start of the episode, consisting of Frieren's Party in the wagon and a conversation between Sein, Stark, and Fern about how long Fern and Stark have been traveling with Frieren. The manga starts with the group walking down a path instead.

- When Frieren's party observes the cursed village, additional scenes are added in the anime, with Frieren noticing that the animals are acting normal and Fern commenting that the inhabitants are breathing.

- In the manga, the conversation about the Magic of the Goddess occurs outdoors instead of indoors in the anime.
Items related to the worship of the Goddess of Creation, such as on the house altar, were designed by the anime's concept artist, Seiko Yoshioka. These details were coordinated with the authors of the manga, Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe, in order to incorporate important elements to fill in the backgrounds of the anime.

- The anime includes an additional scene based on a volume extra from Chapter 31 in the manga: The morning after the Chaos Flower is defeated, Stark wakes up next to Fern against the tree Frieren and Sein placed them against, and he wonders what is happening.

- The city of Vorig and the backyard of Lord Orden's mansion are populated with birch-like trees, as according to Seiko Yoshioka, the trees symbolize "rebirth," "new beginnings," and "growth." These ideas represent how the will of Lord Orden's eldest son, the late Wirt, is passed on to his younger brother, Mut.

- The anime includes original scenes of Frieren, Fern, and Sein's activities across the period of Stark's etiquette training. The anime also depicts the process of Fern's etiquette training, which is not present in the manga.

- The animator for Fern and Stark's ballroom dance segment, key animator MYOUN, stated that the scene was drawn and animated entirely by hand without the use of CGI (computer-generated imagery) or rotoscoping using motion captured figures.
The dance was choreographed by Tatsuro Otake and performed by Satoshi Tateishi and Misaki Tsuyuguchi using motion capture. However, this footage was solely used for reference.

## [ARCS] Episode 16
**Long-Lived Friends** ｢長 (ちょう) 寿 (じゅ) 友 (とも) 達 (だち) , *Chōju tomodachi*?｣ is the sixteenth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on December 22, 2023.

## Synopsis]

Frieren pays a visit to Old Man Voll, a long-lived friend of hers, with traveling companions in tow.

## Plot]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's passing, Sein sits by a campfire smoking while the others appear to be asleep already. He recalls a childhood memory when he was fishing. The activity's tranquility was stopped when his energetic childhood friend came up and dragged him back to the village to get a photo taken by a visiting mage that was taking photos with magic. In the present, Sein looks at a locket with the photo of him and his friend and reminisces about the past.

Later, Frieren's Party arrives at the Klar Region of the Northern Lands. While walking along the road, Stark asks Frieren if the person they are visiting is powerful. Frieren tells Stark that this person, who is a dwarf, has been protecting the village and has reached an age of close to four hundred years. Fern wants to know about the life expectancy of dwarves, which Sein answers is typically three hundred years. Frieren says that the dwarf's name is Old Man Voll, a longtime friend of hers. She wishes to visit him before he dies so she can talk with him. Stark thinks that her idea is a bit morbid, and Fern says that there are not many individuals which her master can talk with about the past. Frieren jokes that maybe she will stay for ten years, but Fern shoots the idea down and warns Frieren that they will be staying there for one week at most.

They arrive at the village to see a dwarf sitting on a rock next to the entrance with a broadsword propped up beside him. Frieren calls out to the dwarf, naming him Old Man Voll. She then turns to Stark and asks him if Voll looks cool for a seasoned elder warrior. Stark, however, is unconvinced, as Voll appears to be going senile. Voll asks Frieren who she is, and Frieren responds with her name and then asks when is he going to drop the act of pretending to be senile. Voll proceeds to knock Stark to the ground with his sheathed blade, and he warns the young man that imprudence is one of the most common causes of deaths on the battlefield, which both demons and people alike fall for. He tells Stark to get up, and he tells him that even master warriors can suffer a fatal injury if they lower their defense. Frieren, smiling, calls Voll out for his underhanded tactics and the dwarf welcomes her to the village, telling her and her party to enjoy themselves. Stark complains that he cannot get up, to which Frieren replies that the warrior should get Voll to train him and the young man acquiesces. All but Stark head through the entrance to check into the village's inn. 

After checking in, Frieren attempts to solicit a job from the innkeeper as she wishes to stay at least ten years, but Fern harshly reprimands her and reminds her that they will be staying for a maximum of one week. Afterwards, while Frieren talks with Voll and Stark trains, the other two party members help a villager with the harvest. Fern and Sein accompany the villager and chat while they bring in the crops with the villager's wagon. The villager thanks them, as there are not many helping hands around. As he notices Frieren and Stark hanging around Voll, he mentions that this is the first time he has seen him so talkative, and he had thought Voll didn't have any friends. The villager continues on, saying that Voll is a senile grandpa with whom you normally cannot hold a conversation with. Because Voll has been protecting the village since long ago, the people regard him akin to a protective deity, but nobody knows why he does so. Fern realizes that Voll might have always been alone.

Throughout the week's stay in the village, Frieren reminisces during her talks with Voll. All the while, Voll trains Stark using various methods, such as making him carry around a large boulder as Voll sits on top. Stark relaxes by fishing, and at night, Frieren's party joins the dwarf in gathering mushrooms that glow in the dark within a nearby forest. Voll, despite his age, has formidable combat prowess, and he demonstrates his strength to Stark by slaying a large, bear-like beast.

On the last day of their visit, Frieren and Voll walk through the forest together. She asks him how Stark's training is progressing, and Voll replies that humans develop quickly and Stark has reasonably improved. Frieren says that it has been fun being with Voll and that she is thankful because he gave her the chance to get to know Himmel and the others all those years ago. Frieren then recalls the memory of the Hero Party's last visit to the village.

In a flashback, Voll sits at the entrance of the village with the Hero Party standing next to him. Himmel asks the dwarf why he protects the village, and Voll says that his reason does not matter anymore. Himmel is unsatisfied with this answer and tells Voll that people do not risk their lives for something that does not matter. Voll then answers Himmel's question seriously: he is just protecting the village that his wife, who was human, loved. He is simply fulfilling a promise to her, but he does not intend on sharing the details, because he can no longer remember anything about her anymore—not his wife's face, gaze, nor her voice. Voll says that it must be foolish, constantly keeping a promise to someone long gone. Himmel replies that perhaps that is the case, but he is sure that Voll's wife is happy that he honors the promise. In response, Voll tells Himmel that he is a good hero and that he will surely defeat the Demon King. He then says that his wife also wished for a peaceful era and that he will carry the memory of Himmel with him into the future. Himmel appreciates his kindness, but since Frieren and Eisen are in his party, there isn't a need. This causes Eisen to respond that he won't live as long as an elf, so Himmel then says that it will be Frieren's duty to carry their memories. Frieren says that she does not mind taking on this role. Voll acknowledges this and tells Himmel that he is blessed with his comrades. Himmel then self-importantly tells Frieren that he will need to show her a compilation of handsome poses after this, making Frieren retort that maybe she should stop remembering him after all.

In the present, Frieren tells Voll that the handsome poses that Himmel made her remember were a waste. Voll then asks if she remembers Himmel's face, to which Frieren immediately replies that she does. He then asks if she remembers his voice. Frieren pauses for a moment, then tells him not to insult her and that she remembers everything because Himmel was her reason for getting to know humans. She says that it is equally as important a reason as to why Voll wants to protect the village. In response, Voll tells Frieren that he cannot even recall his wife's face, voice, or gaze. However, he is protecting this village nonetheless because it is something important to him. 

He then asks where Frieren's party is going on their journey. Frieren tells him that they are going to Aureole, the lands where souls rest. He asks where that is, and she says Ende, which is also where the Demon King's Castle is. Voll replies that this means someone is finally going to defeat the Demon King and he hopes a peaceful era arrives. Frieren is surprised by the fact that Voll has not realized the Demon King is already gone, but she stops mid-sentence and decides not to correct him. She laughs and tells him that she will bring his memory into the future with her as well. Voll sits in contemplation for a moment, then tells Frieren that it sounds like a nice thought and that he is glad to have met her again in the last moments of his life. Frieren tells Voll that he already said that to her eighty years ago.

The next morning, Frieren's party say their farewells to Voll. Frieren tells Voll that she will see him again and to stay strong. As Frieren's party departs from the village, Voll calls out to Frieren and tells her that he had a dream of his wife, probably because he reminisced with Frieren about the past.

Later, Frieren's Party is on the Rohr Road, which connects to major places in the Northern Lands. While traveling along the road, Sein stops to ask a farmer some questions, and he is questioned in turn by the party about why he is on the journey. He tells them that his goal is to reunite with his best friend, who went on a journey a decade ago. He shows them a picture of him and his best friend, which was taken by a mage that visited their village a long time ago. Frieren asks him if he has any leads, and Sein tells her that he has met many eyewitnesses already and they should be fine if they keep traveling north. Stark finds it odd that there are so many people who remember seeing him, but Sein tells him it is because of his friend's distinct name. His friend's name is "Warrior Gorilla", which Stark doubts, so he asks for his real name. Sein expresses that he does not know. He tells Stark that he was always called "Warrior Gorilla" by the villagers, most likely because he asked them to call him that. Sein then tells them that his nickname is "Goatee Priest," prompting Frieren to ask if he was called that even before he grew a goatee. Sein, ignoring this, says that the party just needs to know his friend's name is Warrior Gorilla since that is the name he goes by. Stark calls this Warrior Gorilla strange, and Sein agrees.

The party then arrives at a bridge that stands atop a great gorge. Frieren tells them that if they continue walking for a week after crossing the bridge, they will arrive at Äußerst, the city of magic. Fern complains about how long the journey has been, and Sein suggests that they stop by the village next to the bridge since the road branches off. As soon as they get into the village, Sein begins asking for clues about his friend. One villager tells him that Warrior Gorilla left an incredible impact on the people in the village because he exterminated a monster that appeared near it. Sein asks if the villager knows where Warrior Gorilla went, and he directs the priest to a stubborn old woman who was close with Warrior Gorilla.

They meet the old woman atop the hill that her house stands on, and she introduces herself literally as a stubborn, old woman, which puzzles Stark. The old lady ignores his remark and tells them that she will not give them the information easily, as she intends for them to fulfill a few requests first. For their first task, Frieren's party has to deliver a note to a blacksmith, Nagel, in a neighboring town. The party sets out to complete the request, with Stark complaining to Frieren that they are just running errands. Frieren tells Stark that when she was adventuring with Himmel, this was an everyday occurrence. She adds that those errands would devolve into annoying item searches or monster exterminations. While saying this, she remembers an occasion at which the Hero Party was in full retreat from a fearsome dragon. Frieren says that they should try and open up the old woman's heart. After completing the first task, Sein and Stark pick fruits in an orchard while Fern and Frieren fly to a hill, where they are tasked to pick a yellow flower that grows on its ledge. Later, the two men retrieve a chest from a dungeon, and the two mages collect eggs while escaping from a giant, rooster-like bird that chases after them. Stark defeats a large chimera monster.

After having done many requests for the stubborn old woman, she still acts coldly towards them. Frieren apologizes and tells them that if it was Himmel or Heiter, she would have opened up in half a day. Fern tells them it is because their group is filled with awkward people. The old woman asks them for one final request and hands out cleaning tools. She escorts them to a gorge, during which she tells them about a stone statue of heroes who saved the world a long time ago, but these heroes have since become forgotten heroes whose names are a mystery. She then points out offhandedly that Sein has to be the "Goatee Priest," and the priest asks her how she knew that. They arrive at the statue, which Fern says has a resemblance to Sein and Warrior Gorilla. Frieren interjects that the warrior that is beside the Sein lookalike is likely Kraft. The party then gets started on cleaning the statues, but Sein stands distracted in front of the statue of the forgotten heroes. He muses that the hero's name was Kraft all along, and he then asks about the name of the other hero. Frieren tells Sein that she knows of nobody that resembles the man. 

Sein then recalls a scene from his childhood days. He and Gorilla are standing next to a statue of the same forgotten heroes with Heiter. Heiter asks who those depicted by the statue are, but Gorilla just tells the priest that they look like him and Sein. The boy then says that according to the mayor, the statue depicts former heroes, but no one even remembers their names anymore. Gorilla then declares that he and Sein are not going to end up nameless and that he is going to become a hero as unforgettable as Himmel. Heiter tells them that any hero will eventually be forgotten and that Himmel will not be an exception. Sein agrees with Heiter. However, Gorilla is undeterred and says that if he trains, maybe he will become as strong as the forgotten heroes. He also decides to be called by the name "Warrior Gorilla" from now on. Sein asks why, and Warrior Gorilla tells him that if someone wants to be an unforgettable hero, it is important to have an impactful name. Heiter is amused by this and then tells Sein that in that case, Sein will be the "Goatee Priest." He tells Sein that he will definitely match the goatee of the other forgotten hero in the future.

In the present, Frieren's party finishes polishing the statue. Sein says that it was a pain, and Frieren says that if it was bronze, she could have used magic instead. The old woman tells them that she asked Warrior Gorilla to do the same task, but he could not do it as well as they did. Sein comments that all Warrior Gorilla is good for is fighting. Though she does not disagree, the old woman smiles and says that his name was nevertheless impactful. She recalls having a conversation with Warrior Gorilla while he was cleaning the statue, and she tells Sein that Warrior Gorilla often spoke of him and told her that the two of them would engrave their names in history forever.

After talking with Sein, the old woman sees them off on Rohr Road. Frieren asks Sein if he found out the whereabouts of Gorilla, and he tells him that Gorilla went to Tür, a commercial town in the middle of the Northern Lands. Frieren notes that it is in the opposite direction of Äußerst, where the rest of the party is planning on heading, leaving Sein unsure of what to do now.

## [ARCS] Episode 17
**Take Care** ｢じゃあ元 (げん) 気 (き) で, *Jā genki de*?｣ is the seventeenth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on January 5, 2024. It marks the first episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

Now that Sein finally has a lead on the whereabouts of his long-lost friend, is it time for him and Frieren's Party to part ways?

## Plot]

After Sein learns where Warrior Gorilla went from the stubborn old woman, he remembers how he showed the locket of him and Gorilla to Frieren, Fern, and Stark, where he reminded them that the goal of his journey was to find the whereabouts of his childhood friend. In the present, Sein regroups with Frieren and Fern, and Frieren asks if he found a lead. Sein confirms he did, and Gorilla had gone to the trading city Tür, east of their current location and the opposite direction of Äußerst, the city the party seeks to reach. Sein reiterates that he came along on Frieren's journey to go after Gorilla, and she acknowledges this. Fern remarks that the sun is about to go down and they should defer their decision to the next day. Stark joins the rest of the party after requesting for a cabin within the village, which they plan on staying in overnight.

After sunset, Fern returns from getting supplies and enters with Sein, who carries in some firewood. Inside the cabin, Frieren reads a grimoire and Stark mends his cloths. Fern comments on how cold her hands are, and Frieren says that the weather has gotten quite cold. She holds Fern's hands and notes that they are indeed very chilly. This prompts Stark to also hold Fern's hands to check, but Fern places her hand on his face in return, making him yelp about the cold. Sein watches the banter while stoking the fire, and he thinks about how the situation he just witnessed was ridiculous. After dinner, Fern and Frieren stand near the window, and they realize it is snowing outside. Fern asks Frieren if they will have to pass the winter in a cabin again, but Frieren tells her that as long as there isn't a blizzard, they can move on.

The next day, a serious blizzard hits the village. The village elder, who is renting the cabin to them, informs the adventurers that the cold wave that is currently causing the blizzard will last for about a month. Frieren asks Sein if they should depart, and Sein asks if that is a rhetorical question. They decide to stay until the cold wave passes. 

Frieren comments that staying is not that bad since there are amenities here, unlike the time they got stuck in the mountain cabin. She also adds that there is a magic shop in the village, which is run by a shady old man. In her experience, she is likely to find legendary-level magic in such a place, so she is happy to have time to carefully look through the shop. Stark asks what legendary magic she has found up until now, and Frieren cites magic such as a spell to get rid of mold and a spell that remove tough oil stains. Hearing this, Fern recalls her master showing off the oil stain-removal spell on a pot, which sparkled like new in Fern's hand, and the apprentice labeled the spell as incredible. As these spells are convenient, Fern asserts that they changed her world, but Stark is dismissive of that.

Frieren then repeats that they will have to wait out the cold wave, as they cannot underestimate the winters of the Northern Lands. While they all start to return inside, Sein stays outside and mentions that he knows the winters are harsh, given he was born in the north. He looks into the distance and pleasantly comments to himself that he will be staying with the party for a bit longer.

Frieren's party then spends a month in the village, and they occasionally share meals together in the cabin. Fern spends time reading books, Stark trains his body, Frieren takes her time to go through the contents of the old man's magic shop, and Sein frequents the local inn. Near the end of the cold wave, Sein has a drink with the village elder in the tavern. The townsfolk tell him that the cold wave is almost over, so their party can depart soon. This leads Sein to ruminate on the fact that the party was not together for much time at all. Suddenly, Frieren comes through the door, asking him to spare a moment. Sein says it is unusual for Frieren to be seen at the tavern. Frieren explains that Stark and Fern are acting up again, so she is asking him to mediate between them. Sein asks why, and Frieren tells him it is because mediation is the job of a priest.

They go back to the cabin to see Stark sobbing and Fern pouting as she sits with her back to him. Sein comments on the poor situation and asks what happened. Fern tells him that it is all Stark's fault, with which the young man agrees. Sein then drags them into a room one-by-one, starting with Stark. Sein asks Stark what exactly led to the situation. Stark recalls how he stood behind Fern and rested one hand on her shoulder to touch Fern's cheek with his other cold hand like she did to him when they first arrived at the cabin. Sein tells him that no girl would like her face to be touched like that, and he asks him if he wants things to stay as is. Stark responds that he does not and wishes to reconcile with Fern. Sein tells Stark that he is good at heart, and to properly make up with someone, he must express his true feelings. As Frieren takes a peek through the opened door, the priest goes on to say that, especially in the future, Frieren will not mediate such arguments. Stark decides to apologize to Fern.

Next, Fern shares her side of the events. Sein explains to the young girl that Stark felt bad about what happened, and, as a kid, he did not mean any harm. She tells the priest that it was her fault to begin with and that she, too, would like to apologize instead of being stubborn. She tells him that being touched was not the concern, but the grip Stark had on her shoulder was too strong and she found it a little frightening. Sein asks Fern if she does not like Stark. Fern asks why he would ask that, and she asks if it seemed like she hated Stark. Instead of a direct reply, he advises her to tell Stark that she was just scared and she would like to reconcile. Stark and Fern then make up with each other, with Fern asking him to be gentler and Stark responding that he is sorry.

Afterward, Frieren and Sein have drinks at the tavern. While drinking, Sein angrily slams his tankard on the table, shouting exuberantly that he wishes Fern and Stark would just get together already. Frieren tells him that she does not understand what he is talking about, but she can see that he has been working very hard. Sein smiles and says that Frieren is the only one who would praise him like a kid. Frieren asserts that to her, he is practically one. Sein says that isn't too bad and then asks Frieren why she was always so concerned with him, going as far as to give him an invitation on this journey. Frieren repeats the words she said to Fern and Stark, where she feels a dislike towards those who are like her, which includes Sein. 

Frieren shortly recalls a memory where she was gathering herbs during her time in seclusion. Sein's strong refusal at first reminded Frieren of her older self during this time, before she went to subjugate the Demon King. Sein refused to go adventuring just like she did, and that angered her. Sein counters that this does not directly relate to what he asked, and Frieren tells him that she felt that she wanted to give him a reason to go adventuring, just like what Himmel the Hero would have done. Once more, she recalls in a flashback the day Himmel first showed up with Heiter and Eisen. Himmel reached out to her to go on the adventure with him and the others, as he wanted to be her reason to do so. In the present, Frieren looks through a window outside as she ruminates that Himmel's words were what made her courageous enough to travel, and the Hero Party taught her how fun it was to spend time with friends. Frieren then asks the party member if it was fun for him to be an adevnturer, and Sein replies that it was.

After the talk, Sein steps outside of the tavern to have a smoke in the cold evening. He thinks back to the steps leading up to his journey, which includes the memory of Gorilla announcing that he would become an unforgettable hero like Himmel, Frieren recruiting him and telling him to think in the present, Heiter explaining that he trusts Frieren's words, the stubborn granny saying that Gorilla talked about how he and Sein would become heroic adventurers whose names would be remembered forever, Gorilla offering him his hand to go adventure together, him getting slapped by his older brother, Frieren patting his head, him telling Stark what the mirrored lotus flower meant, him advising Fern, and, lastly, him getting dragged around as a young boy with his friend. He fondly thinks about the memories of his past as he watches the snow fall. 

After the storm passes, Frieren's party arrives at the bridge over the gorge that splits the paths to Tür and Äußerst. Sein tells the party members that he has decided to pursue Gorilla after all, saying that he does not want to bear any more regrets. Frieren acknowledges his decision and they bid each other farewell. Stark notes that they are saying goodbye much more easily than expected. Frieren tells him that since Sein is an adult, he will be fine. Sein walks on alone and has a reminisces his journey with Frieren's party over the past few months. He smiles and utters to himself how quiet it is when he travels alone. Now separated with Sein, Frieren, Stark, and Fern continue on their journey.

Twenty-nine years after Himmel's passing, Frieren's party arrive at the Offen Mountain Range. Stark returns from gathering food through the snow-covered landscape to the party's camp under a ledge of a cave. He sees that both Frieren and Fern are still asleep, which is unusual. He comments that they have been walking non-stop, so they could still be tired. He then prepares their breakfast with a fish he caught and other ingredients he gathered. He attempts to wake the other members, but they are unresponsive.

As Stark continues attempting to wake Fern up, he notices that she appears unwell, so he lets her sleep. He tries to wake up Frieren, but she mumbles to let her sleep longer. He successfully manages to rouse her by placing his cold hands and her cheek, and Frieren begrudgingly awakes. She checks on Fern and deduces that she has a fever. Frieren combs through her suitcase and takes out notes that Sein left on medicinal herbs. She tells Stark that if she diagnoses Fern with magic, she can use these notes to figure out what herbs can counteract the illness. Stark voices his uncertainty, as that kind of magic is done with the Goddess's magic, which requires a Holy Scripture that only the owner can cast with. Frieren tells Stark that she has a scripture, and she points to a book she was using as a pot stand, which Stark finds outrageous. 

Frieren successfully casts a spell that identifies illnesses, noting that even though she isn't a priest, she is able to apply simple spells. She figures out that Fern's ailment is just a cold. Frieren checks the herbs they need and recalls a place in the Offen Mountain Range where she and the Hero Party once collected herbs. After this, Stark recommends they find shelter away from the cold.

Frieren and Stark discover a homestead in the mountains, and they carry Fern to it. The owner of the cabin notices their presence and offers her cabin for Fern to rest in. Stark thanks the woman, while also noting that it was surprising to find someone living deep in the mountains. Frieren comments that the last time she came here, there was a village here, and the woman tells her that it has been several decades since. Frieren then asks if there was an Icicle Cherry Blossom tree in the area. The cabin owner replies that there is one north of the current location, although it is difficult to get to. Frieren tells her that it is fine since she has been here before. The woman excuses herself to turn back to her usual work and moves outside.

Frieren tells Fern to wait a bit while holding her hand and that they will get the medicinal ingredients needed to cure her. Stark questions why Frieren has been constantly holding Fern's hand since they arrived, and Frieren tells Stark that she does that because Fern looks like she is in pain, and holding her hand while she has a cold has always calmed her down when she was child. This notion prompts Fern to remove her hand from Frieren's and voice her embarrassment. Frieren asks why, and Fern tells her to stop treating her like a child, which Frieren accepts.

While the duo walks north to find the tree, Frieren comments that in just two years, Fern will become an adult. She says that it still feels like yesterday when Fern was just a small girl. She emphasizes it by pointing out Fern's height back then, and she explains that she used to be far taller than Fern. In what Frieren perceives to be a blink of an eye, the girl has grown to be an adult, but she still feels like a child to her, and this will likely be the case for a long while. On their way to the tree, Frieren and Stark collect some of the ingredients needed for the medicine. As they continue on, they encounter a tortoise-like creature covered with snow, pass by a frozen waterfall, and take shelter from a snowstorm.

Frieren tells Stark that they will soon reach the tree, and Stark assumes that the Icicle Cherry Blossom is the final ingredient in the medicine, but Frieren corrects him and says that the mushrooms that grow at the roots of the tree are the final ingredient. Once they arrive, Frieren comments on how majestic the tree looks, and she expresses that she wishes to show the tree to Fern as well. She adds that the Icicle Cherry Blossom tree is her favorite flowering tree that blooms in the winter. While they are looking at the tree, Stark asks Frieren why she held Fern's hand in the cabin, adding that she has never treated her as a child to that extent before. Frieren tells Stark that she had no intention of treating Fern like a child and that she simply did it because she was in pain and it was the only way she knew to ease it. She asks Stark what she should have done. Stark thinks about it, and he answers that he believes they should follow what the heart says to do, or at least that is what his master always told him. He then says that people require emotional support, and there isn't anyone who would feel bad about receiving it.

Frieren has a flashback to a time she was sick, with Himmel sitting at her bedside and holding her hand. When she asked him why, Himmel told her it was because she seemed to be having a nightmare in her sleep and that people feel helpless when they are sick. He revealed that although he lost his mother at a young age, as a kid, his mother would often hold his hand to calm him down. Frieren objected to him doing the same for her, as his mother comforted him when he was a child. Himmel responded by saying that children are not the only ones who require emotional support, and Frieren agreed that the comfort didn't feel bad. Himmel joked around and told her that his handsomeness comes through when he is worried about others, which prompted Frieren to tell him to be quiet. A moment later, Heiter and Eisen entered the room with medicine for her.

Back in the present, Stark adds that Fern was probably embarrassed because he was around, saying that she would not want anyone to see her being spoiled. Frieren thanks Stark for what he said, and she tells him that she will do as her heart says. As a token of her gratitude, she suggests holding his hand when he is sick. Stark refuses the offer, saying that it would be embarrassing. Frieren goes ahead and picks a huge mushroom, which is much more massive than Stark imagined. 

Afterward, Frieren mixes the ingredients in a giant cauldron, which, according to Stark, makes her look like a witch. Later, back in a room of the cabin, Frieren spoon-feeds Fern the medicine. While this occurs, Stark helps out the cabin owner around the homestead. Back inside, Frieren holds Fern's hand, and Frieren says she will get better soon. Fern is reluctant about holding hands and tells Frieren that she is no longer a child. Frieren says that she knows this, but she still continues to hold her hand, which prompts Fern to relax, and her facial expression softens to a smile. 

After Fern's condition improves, the trio bids farewell to the cabin owner, and Fern thanks the lady for the accommodation. She then also directs her thanks to Frieren and Stark and includes Sein because of the notes he left behind. They depart for their journey with Frieren leading the way, with their next stop being the city of magic: Äußerst.

It is the second episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

Frieren and party finally arrive in Äußerst, ready to undergo the first-class mage exam, and meet a number of colorful characters who are there to do the same.

## Plot]

Twenty-nine years after Himmel the Hero's passing, Frieren's Party arrives at the Kühl Region in the Northern Lands, where they see Äußerst—the largest magical city in the Northern Lands—in the distance. The party continues towards the city and they discuss their travel plans, with Fern musing that after Frieren obtains the qualification to become a first-class mage in Äußerst, the party will be able to enter the Northern Plateau. However, Frieren tells Fern to become a first-class mage instead, as she is uninterested in a title that will soon be obsolete. Fern reminds Frieren that only a select few mages are able to become first-class, and she deems herself incapable of obtaining the certification. Nevertheless, Frieren remains uninterested in the exam. Stark asks why travelers are required to be accompanied by such a powerful mage to enter the Northern Plateau, and Frieren answers that the land is inhabited by cunning, magic-using monsters like the Einsam, which makes it dangerous to cross without a priest and a skilled mage.

Sometime later, the trio catches a wagon that takes them in to Äußerst. Frieren states that they will investigate the First-Class Mage Exam once they arrive, but as it will likely include combat assignments, they will need to strategize beforehand. Fern questions the necessity of strategizing, as Frieren is powerful enough to handle any kind of test. Fern adds that even while under suppression, Frieren's observable mana output is that of an experienced, old mage. Frieren sulks in response to being called an old mage, and Stark bids Fern to apologize for her commentary on Frieren's age. Frieren reminds Stark that she has not forgotten about him calling her an "old hag," and she then lies down on Fern's lap in order to take a nap. However, Frieren decides to forgo the nap as, due to Fern's chest, she is only able to see half of the sky when lying down. Frieren gives Fern a word of caution that mana is not the only thing that determines a mage's strength, and she lists out other factors. Frieren then mentions that the final quality which can make a mage's strength superior is simply talent. In her life, she has lost eleven times to mages that possessed less mana than her. Four of them were demons, with Qual being one of them, one was an elf like her, and the remaining six were humans.

Around the same time, a young woman arrives at the the frontier of Graf Granat's Domain in the Northern Lands. She comments that the Graf's city should be coming into view soon and that the route to Äußerst is steep. As she rests while holding her staff, a voice calls out to her and notes that she has a nice staff. The woman sees three men with weapons, remarking that they are bandits. She bemoans that despite the region finally enjoying some peace after Aura's defeat, such crowds are still present. The leader questions who told her to speak, but he is interrupted mid-sentence by a punch to his stomach by Kraft, who suddenly appears between the woman and the men. Kraft's punch sends the man flying. Enraged, the other two men try to attack him but proceed to get beaten up as well. Kraft advises the bandits to leave if they value their lives, prompting them to retreat.

The woman thanks Kraft for saving her and introduces herself as the mage Übel. In response, Kraft introduces himself as the monk Kraft. Übel notices that Kraft is an elf and expresses her surprise, as this is the first time she has seen one in person. Kraft observes Übel and tells her she has the eyes of a killer, refuting her remark that he saved her. He explains that he found the corpses of bandits in the woods nearby and deduced they were killed by a skilled mage. Hearing this, Übel questions whether Kraft intends to preach to her, but Kraft denies any intent to guilt her for killing someone in self-defense and, as an adventurer, he simply wants to save the lives he sees in front of him. Übel proclaims that he is a boring, no-fun old man, and she turns to continue her journey north. Kraft asks if she is heading to Äußerst, and Übel confirms this, as she intends to take the first-class mage exam there. As Kraft leaves, he notes that Frieren said the same thing, and he looks forward to discussing their adventures when they meet again.

Sometime later, Frieren's party goes to register for the exam at the Northern Branch of the Continental Magic Association. A receptionist explains that the exam will take place in two months and is administered once every three years. She also informs Frieren and Fern of the requirement that prospective examinees must be a fifth-class mage or higher to register. As an uncertified mage, Frieren turns and goes to leave the building, telling Fern that it is up to her to pass the exam. Fern holds Frieren back and pleads for her to participate, but Frieren is adamant that Fern can become a first-class mage on her own. Fern asks what they will do if she fails, as their other options will be incredibly expensive. Frieren stresses that, even so, she is uncertified, so she will not be able to participate. She takes out her Holy Emblem and figures that it might not be enough to get her registered for the exam. However, an old man notices the emblem and asks to see it. He appears to recognize the Holy Emblem and inspects it with astonishment as he questions if Frieren is intending to take the exam. 

Outside of the building, Frieren notes her surprise that someone still recognizes the Holy Emblem and that she is now allowed to participate in the first-class exam. Fern wonders why the emblem is impressive, and Frieren thinks back to her time with the Hero Party. Himmel had asked Frieren if she was a member of a magic guild, and Frieren explained that because magic organizations change so frequently, it became bothersome for her to periodically register for the new ones. She brought out her Holy Emblem and implied that with the emblem, joining an organization would be unnecessary. However, none of the members of the Hero Party recognized it, and Frieren told them that it was the only proof she had of her being a mage. Himmel reassured Frieren that though the Hero Party may not know about the emblem, they do know that Frieren is an incredible mage. In response, Frieren nonchalantly said that they would be dead soon and walked away. As Frieren pensively recalls this memory in the present day, Fern calls out to her and reassures her that she and Stark both know that Frieren is an incredible mage, just as Himmel did in the past. Frieren appears surprised by her words but acknowledges her statement by patting her head.

Sometime later, Frieren and Fern begin to research about the Continental Magic Association at a library. Frieren reads and summarizes that mages are considered to be full-fledged mages once they reach at least the certification of fifth-class. She asks Fern why she chose to become a third-class mage, and Fern replies that it was simply because the third-class exam was scheduled the earliest. Frieren summarizes that there are approximately two thousand mages in total, with about six-hundred mages that hold a fifth-class or above certification and the remaining mages being sixth to ninth-class apprentices. Of the mages that are certified at fifth-class or above, there are only a total of forty-five first-class mages. Frieren notes that there have been years where no one had passed the first-class mage exam; additionally, casualties were not unheard of either. Frieren muses that the number of mages in recent times has significantly decreased, as a century ago, when the war against the Demon King intensified, one could encounter at least one mage in any town, whereas nowadays, it seems like mages can only be seen in magic towns.

Over the course of the next two months, Fern and Frieren train their magic in various ways and conduct further research in the library. During these two months, the party also celebrates Frieren's birthday. Finally, Frieren and Fern arrive at the Continental Magic Association to take the exam alongside various other examinees. There, first-class mage Genau is introduced as the proctor of the first stage of the exam. He announces the start of the exam and explains that only the most exceptional mages will reach the title of first-class. He adds that the exams are quite dangerous, and even if anything happens to an examinee, the association will not intervene.

Meanwhile, two onlookers, a male and a female mage, also listen to Genau's speech. The male mage comments on the impressive backgrounds of some of the participants: second-class mage Wirbel, the captain of the Northern Magic Corps that has been active in the fight against the remnants of the Demon King Army, second-class mage Denken, an elderly man who had won bloody power struggles as an Imperial Mage, and Fern, the youngest mage ever to pass the third-class exam with the highest possible score. The man also notices some troublemakers, namely Übel, and he points out that she is a third-class mage who failed the second-class exam two years prior when she killed the exam's first-class mage proctor. Übel glances over at the mages, and the female mage expresses uneasiness upon seeing her. The man then senses Frieren's mana and states that she is radiating the mana of an experienced old mage. He asks the female mage if she knows who she is, but she does not recognize her either.

Genau then announces that for the first stage of the exam, the fifty-seven examinees will be assigned into parties of three via engraved bracelets. Frieren's bracelet designates her as part of the second party, and the elf imbues it with mana to locate her other team members. On the way, Frieren considers that cooperating with other mages impromptu may be difficult, and as such, she resolves to have a good first impression on her team. However, upon locating her party members, she sees two girls, with one sitting on top of the other and pulling at her pigtails. As the two of them fight each other, Frieren looks resigned. Meanwhile, Fern finds her team members as well: one of them is a male mage with glasses, and the other is Übel. Übel and Fern both greet each other, baring the bracelets that show they are part of the fourth party.

Genau brings the examinees to the Grobe Basin—a basin surrounded by woods and the test site for the first stage of the exam—where he specifies the conditions of the test. He holds up a cage with a bird and identifies it as a Stille, a species that lives within the testing grounds. After each party receives an empty cage, Genau explains that in order to pass, two conditions must be fulfilled: each party must possess a caged Stille by sunset the next day, and all three party members must be present. A magic barrier encompasses the exam site, and although the examinees are free to do as they wish, they should not leave the testing location, else the whole party will be disqualified.

During this, Frieren's teammates bicker over who holds the cage as Frieren watches with fatigue. One of the girls questions the necessity of Genau's warning given the strength of the barrier, and Frieren comments that at least the girls seem to be listening to the explanation. As the different teams begin to scatter, Frieren's group members continue to fight over the privilege of carrying the cage. Frieren suggests they should start by introducing themselves while they walk. Seeing that there is still no end to their fighting, Frieren tells the girls to settle the matter of who holds the cage through rock-paper-scissors. As they walk through the woods, Frieren's teammates introduce themselves as Kanne and Lawine, both third-class mages who went to the same Academy of Magic.

After introductions, Frieren asks the two if they know anything about their target, the Stille. When they respond that they do not, Frieren admits that although she knows of the Stille, she has never seen one in person before. Thus, she suggests their first goal should be to find a Stille and observe it. As they search, the bickering between the young mages continues, and after searching for a while, Kanne begins to complain that she is tired. Though Lawine chides her, Frieren thinks it is a good idea to take a break. Lawine states that she has no need for rest and decides to scout ahead. Kanne believes that they should stick together, but Lawine argues that doing so is inefficient. Exasperated, Frieren asks Lawine about her strength. Lawine quickly says that she is more powerful than Kanne, nearly causing another fight between the two, but Frieren interjects and asks Lawine if she is powerful compared to Frieren herself. Lawine responds that she would not want to fight her. Hearing this, Frieren tells her she is free to go scout ahead but to come back immediately if there is danger. As Lawine departs, Frieren advises her to be careful of the sky, which Lawine responds dismissively to as she is already aware of potential dangers above them. However, Kanne reacts with confusion at Frieren's warning.

Now alone with Kanne, Frieren slumps down and wonders if their party will be alright. Kanne tells Frieren that she reminds her of a teacher and that she would make for a good leader. Frieren refutes her by saying that she is only stepping up because Kanne and Lawine keep fighting. Kanne apologizes, and she mentions that she and Lawine have always been this way. She then asks Frieren what she meant when she told Lawine to be wary of the sky. Frieren tells her that her advice was literal, and she questions whether the young mage has trouble sensing mana. Kanne wonders why Frieren would want to know, but before Frieren can reply, the two of them are interrupted by Lawine, who returns and reports that she has found a Stille.

Lawine leads the party to a Stille resting in a body of water, and they begin observing the bird. Frieren praises Lawine for finding it and states that they should carefully observe. However, she is cut off by Kanne casting a spell that manipulates the water with her staff. Sensing the disturbance in the water, the Stille begins to fly upwards, and Kanne manipulates the lake water into a spiral that follows the bird. Frieren states that the bird will be able to escape the water's reach, but Lawine immediately contradicts this as she casts her own magic, freezing the water around the Stille and trapping it in the air. 

Frieren appears impressed by the two mages' teamwork, but she quickly tells them to take cover. They comply, but Lawine questions why they need to take caution. Shortly after, the Stille bursts out of its icy restraint and speeds away, causing the water to part through a shockwave and splash over all three party members. Frieren explains that the Stille is incredibly tough and can fly faster than the speed of sound, which makes their attempt to restrain the bird pointless. As a result, their best course of action would be to spend the rest of the day observing the birds. Frieren then notes to herself that the two girls' perfect timing and coordination in their prior display of magic could not have been achieved overnight. She considers that their party has potential to obtain a Stille, but she takes the thought back when her team members immediately begin to argue again.

The second party continues to search the Grobe Basin for their target. As the search progresses, the group finds and observes a Stille by a pond, though the bird ultimately escapes with tremendous speed, leaving an aftermath reminiscent of an explosion's. At nighttime, Kanne awakens and discovers that Frieren is gone. As she listens to the sounds of the environment, Kanne hears rain. She goes to a cliff and uses light from her staff to investigate, ultimately realizing that the barrier is blocking the raindrops from falling. As she stares skyward, she is suddenly caught by surprise when a large, bird-like monster strikes her on her shoulder using its sharp tail.

The bird monster pounces on her and holds her down with its talons, knocking her staff away in the process. Kanne is unable to reach her staff to defend herself, and with the monster looming over her, Kanne calls out for Lawine. The monster is suddenly subdued with restraint magic, and Frieren appears besides it, reminding a shocked Kanne that she told her to watch the skies. Kanne eventually calms down from the ambush as she sits at the cliff with Frieren. Frieren proceeds to ask Kanne why she called out for Lawine, as she thought the two hated each other based on their frequent scuffles. Kanne agrees that she does hate Lawine, which leads Frieren to ask how they work well together despite this. Kanne admits that she can freeze up at crucial times due to her cowardice and recalls her first flight magic training at a cliff, where she was too scared to attempt flying. Lawine stood beside her while the rest of their classmates had already successfully flown far off into the distance, and she tried to encourage Kanne by pointing out that there was water beneath them. Lawine added that if Kanne did not dare to fly, then she could kick her off the cliff for a boost. This prompted Kanne to say that she hated Lawine because she was always saying mean things and reminded her that she was the type that grows with praise instead.

Hearing this, Lawine called Kanne spoiled and said that she would praise Kanne when she was actually able to fly. Undeterred, Kanne told Lawine to tell her about her strengths, to which Lawine initially responded dismissively. However, after seeing Kanne's despondency, she admitted that Kanne was someone that would work hard even though she was a coward. Kanne asked her to say more, so Lawine talked about how hard Kanne worked in secret, her attentiveness and care towards her peers, and that she was cute when she smiled. Upon hearing the last quality, Kanne bluntly expressed disgust and called Lawine creepy, which prompted Lawine to kick her off the cliff as she had promised earlier. Kanne, despite her fright, was able to break her fall with her flight magic when she was close to the water. She was shortly joined by Lawine, who smiled and told Kanne she was able to use flight magic after all, so she won't be kind to her anymore.

In the present, Kanne tells Frieren that despite Lawine's harshness, she has always led her properly. She reveals that the lesson she learned from Lawine was that even frightening things can work out well if left to impulse. After this discussion, Kanne tells Frieren that she has noticed something about the Stille. Frieren expresses interest in her discovery and says that it might help them capture a Stille.

## [ARCS] Episode 19
**Well-Laid Plans** ｢入 (にゅう) 念 (ねん) な計 (けい) 画 (かく) , *Nyūnen na keikaku*?｣ is the nineteenth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on January 19, 2024. It is the third episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

Frieren and her new teammates hatch a plan to capture a Stille - but are the other teams just going to stand by and let it happen?

## Plot]

After Frieren and Kanne return to the campsite, Kanne goes to sleep while Frieren remains awake, watching the fire. Frieren recalls how Kanne described Lawine as someone that would drag her in the right direction despite how hard she is on her, and this reminds Frieren of a similar occurrence during the Hero Party's journey. As the Hero Party was about to fight a dragon, both Eisen and Himmel admitted they were scared, and Himmel apologized for not being able to encourage them like other adventurers could with each other. Eisen refuted this, as thanks to Himmel's words, he no longer felt tense. Heiter added that Himmel should just be himself since different parties do things differently, and Himmel agreed. In the present, Frieren also agrees with Heiter's words.

Elsewhere during the night, Fern's party manages to catch a Stille. Fern is relieved at their success, but Übel and the male mage remind her that they still need to defend the bird from other parties. Übel excitedly declares that it is time for them to fight other mages.

The next morning, Frieren, Kanne, and Lawine review what they have learned from observing the Stille birds. Kanne brings up that the birds can fly faster than the speed of sound, which they cannot keep up with. She adds that they are also as tough as dragons, which means that regular spells have no effect and they cannot be easily restrained. Lawine pitches in that the Stille are sensitive to mana, so even if they approach one while surpressing their mana, it will still flee. Finally, their main problem is that the Stille have practically no mana themselves, which prevents them from detecting them and pinpointing where they're located. As a result, they are uncertain how many Stille there are. Kanne notes that they saw three the previous day, and the birds are likely acting cautious due to the presence of the examinees searching for them. In the worst case, the Stille may not show themselves again, and even if they find one, they are still uncertain how to catch it.

Frieren tells Kanne and Lawine not to worry about catching the Stille, as she has been experimenting with a spell that might enable them to catch one. She refers to the spell as a spell that captures a bird, which was previously a form of folk magic used by hunters back when magic was more commonplace. Frieren points out that Kanne has already seen this spell, and Kanne recalls the binding spell that Frieren used the previous night to save her from the bird monster. She asks why the spell worked, as the target was a monster and not a bird, and Frieren guesses that because the spell is folk magic, it can capture anything that resembles a bird. Lawine questions why Frieren did not bring up the spell earlier as they could have used it to catch the Stille they previously saw, but Frieren reveals the spell is limited to a range of fifty centimeters, which is a much shorter distance than the closest they have gotten to one of the birds, a distance of three meters. Kanne adds that the Stille was also already aware of them when they got within twenty meters of it.

With this information, Frieren figures that they still need to find a way to get close to a Stille. She checks that Kanne and Lawine are unable to restrain it with their magic, and Lawine states that although it may be possible if she manages to freeze one, the Stille are still sensitive to mana and resistant to freezing, which would prevent them from keeping one in place. Kanne supposes that if she had access to a large amount of water, she could keep a Stille in place, but she is unable to produce water and can only control existing water. Additionally, it is difficult to penetrate a large body of water with mana, so she would have to infuse water with her mana beforehand, and if the body of water is scattered like rain, she can easily manipulate it. However, the Stille would be sensitive to the water if she infused it and stay away. Kanne's last point interests Frieren, and she comes up with a plan and shares it with her teammates.

After hearing Frieren's plan, Lawine considers that while it has potential, it would be risky to carry out, as they would be antagonizing the other examinees. Kanne underscores the fact that this might be their only way to catch a Stille, and she asks Lawine if she is scared. This prompts Lawine to once again sit on top of Kanne and pull her pigtails as a bewildered Frieren watches. After she calms down, Lawine agrees to follow along with Frieren's plan.

Meanwhile, the fourth party takes shelter in a cave. The male mage, Land, a second-class mage, suggests that the three of them hide until the end of the exam. Übel disagrees, stating that hiding would be boring and mages should fight with dignity, but Land counters that mages should also avoid unnecessary fights. Übel does not respond and instead goes to take a sip of water from her canteen, only to find it empty. Land notices this and concedes, suggesting that they should first replenish their water at the lake at the center of the testing grounds.

As the fourth party walks towards the lake, Übel carries the cage with the Stille while Land expresses relief that they managed to catch a Stille early on, and if they avoid conflict until sunset, they will pass. Übel chuckles at this and reveals it might not go that smoothly. She points out that they were walking on what she thought was a road, but in actuality, it is a dried-up riverbed. With this, Fern and Land deduce that the barrier erected around the examination ground is also blocking the flow of water. Übel notes that based on how dry the ground is, the barrier must have been erected over a week ago, and Fern realizes that most of the water within the exam grounds would have gathered in the lake at the center of the Grobe Basin. As the Stille cannot carry their own water, they will likely congregate at the lake. Thus, Land concludes that the lake is the most probable place to find a Stille, and other examinees that have realized this are likely lying in wait around the lake. Land decides that they should give up on retrieving water from the lake, but Übel protests. They begin walking back as Land and Übel discuss other options, but suddenly, multiple spells are cast towards them.

Fern manages to defend her team from the initial ambush. The three mages making up the eighth party appear: Wirbel, Scharf, and Ehre, and they face off one-on-one against Übel, Land, and Fern, respectively. Wirbel remarks that he attacked with the intent to kill and expresses his surprise that Fern was able to defend against it. He commands the fourth party to leave their Stille behind; when Übel asks him what will happen if they refuse, Wirbel replies that they have no need to say anything else. However, the fight is abruptly interrupted by a resounding cracking sound and a giant, skyward beam of light erupting from the lake.

At the middle of the lake, Lawine casts her ice magic and freezes the entirety of the lake while the parties hiding nearby watch in shock. Wirbel senses the mana and identifies the culprit of the commotion as a member of the second party, and he questions if the second party intends to make an enemy out of all of the other teams. Back at the lake, Lawine sprints away, and the parties surrounding the lake attempt to melt the ice with fire magic.

The thirteenth party, consisting of Denken, Richter, and Laufen, watch the chaos. Richter asks Denken what they should do, and Denken concludes that it is not worth attempting to melt the ice, as the Stille will not return to the lake after the previous display of magic. He decides that they will steal the second party's Stille, as such a showy act would mean they have a method to capture a Stille. As the second party searches around the exam site, Fern wonders what Frieren is planning. To deal with their confrontation with the eighth party, Land calls for his teammates to split up.

Denken continues observing the other parties that are trying to melt the ice and calls them foolish for using up so much mana in the attempt to do so. He sees another party, who has taken to the skies instead to search for Stille, and he comments that some parties are electing to search for other sources of water, but their inexperience and inadequate mana detection will leave them vulnerable to airborne threats. Another party runs past the thirteenth party, and they complain that the second party froze the lake and wonder if they are trying to ruin the exam. Denken hears this and explains that on the contrary, the freezing of the lake must be part of a well-laid plan by the second party, vowing to dismantle it. 

As the thirteenth party heads away from the lake, they comes across the bodies of one of the teams that had taken the aerial approach to search for the Stille. Based on their injuries and the way they have been strung up in a tree, Denken concludes that the party must have been attacked by monsters and confirms that they are dead. Laufen requests that they at least take the bodies down, but Denken directs her attention skywards, where a flock of bird monsters circle above. Denken explains that these monsters, the Geisel, cast magic on the corpses and use them as lures to hunt those that attempt to move the bodies. Hearing this, Laufen points out that it is strange the exam is being administered in such a dangerous area and with no care towards the examinees' safety, prompting Richter to wonder if this is Laufen's first time taking the First-Class Mage Exam. He explains to her that any mage that would die from the exam is not qualified to become a first-class mage in the first place. He adds that the Continental Magic Association is very mindful of maintaining the quality of their first-class mages, and their high standards are in part from glorifying the powerful mages that fought against the Demon King's Army.

Denken voices his distaste of the Continental Magic Association's views, which surprises Richter, who expected Denken to agree with the association's ideology. Denken argues that first-class mages exist solely to be symbols of power and thus, the quality of the mages is irrelevant, as those that lack the ability to connect with and win the hearts of the people are effectively powerless, no matter how strong they are. He reflects back to his time as an Imperial Mage, where he saw many mages more skilled than him fall from power and be persecuted, and he concludes that those who are powerful may have authority because they are feared, but this authority does not last. Additionally, Denken states that magic is not something to be proud of anyways. Hearing this, Richter queries if being as weak as Denken would be ideal then, to which Denken replies that he could beat Richter with his eyes closed. 

As the second party continues laying out their plan, the thirteenth party attempts to find them without success. Denken reveals that he has detected traces of mana in all of the watering holes they have come across. Although the mana's presence is extremely faint and undetectable to Richter and Laufen, Denken realizes the Stille is able to sense it. Laufen grasps that the intent of the second party is to isolate a watering hole without mana, which would be where the second party waits for a Stille. Denken confirms this, and when Laufen questions how they will find the second party, Denken responds that the second party will eventually reveal their location.

The second party rendezvous at a watering hole, where Kanne reports that she has poured her mana into all sources of water she could find. Frieren tells her and Lawine that she will wait for a Stille, and she proceeds to sit down and fully conceal her mana. Lawine expresses shock that Frieren is able to make her mana completely disappear, but Frieren points out that she must maintain complete stillness or else mana will end up leaking out. The two girls head into the forest to stand guard, bickering along the way.

As the day passes, Frieren patiently waits for a Stille to arrive. Various forms of wildlife approach the pool, including a Geisel, which does not seem to perceive the presence of Frieren. Finally, after much time has elapsed, a Stille lands on Frieren's shoulder. She smiles at it before restraining it with her spell that captures a bird. Seeing this, Kanne and Lawine approach and ask if Frieren was able to capture a Stille, and Frieren shows them the cage with the Stille inside. An excited Kanne believes that they will now pass the first stage of the exam, but Frieren senses something and denies her statement.

Elsewhere in the testing grounds, Denken senses Frieren's mana when she uses magic to capture the Stille, and he states that no matter how skilled a mage is, they will always utilize magic in the end, which is impossible to conceal. Laufen subsequently disappears. At the water hole, Frieren notices that another party has detected them and tells Kanne and Lawine that they should hurry and relocate, but Laufen suddenly appears in front of the second party and blocks off their escape route. Frieren retracts her statement and states that it is too late for them to depart.

In the meantime, the confrontation between the fourth and eighth parties intensify. Scharf stands among a field of flowers and casts his Jubelade spell, which converts flower petals into needles that he sends flying towards Land, grazing him on the face. Ehre flies into the air above Fern while surrounded by rocks, and she casts Doragate, which enables her to use the rocks as swift projectiles that rain down on Fern. Fern blocks the projectiles with defensive magic and proceeds to cast multiple blasts of Zoltraak around Ehre. Ehre is forced to evade the attacks, and she comments that her adversary is showing no opening. She adds that the technique Fern uses is refined but old, and she compares it to fighting her grandfather. Ehre questions if Fern is incapable of using spells other than ordinary offensive and defensive magic, and Fern replies that her master taught her to strictly use only basic magic in combat. Ehre asks if that is her master's philosophy, and Fern responds that she was told it was enough to defeat mages of this era. 

Ehre unleashes another array of stone bullets, which are once again blocked by Fern's defensive magic. Ehre feels uneasiness, as fighting Fern feels like she is facing off against a seasoned mage. She lands and remarks that Fern would struggle if she were facing off against Wirbel, and with the technique she is using, she would already be dead. Fern rebuttals the notion as nonsense and questions Ehre that she is of the impression that Ehre is the strongest among both the fourth and eighth parties. Ehre does not respond to her observation, instead pointing out that Wirbel is the captain of the Northern Magic Corps that fought against the remnants of the forces of the Demon King, and as a result, his experience eclipses everyone else's. She labels Wirbel's magic as magic that is underhanded, devoid of character, and used for the sole purpose of winning. Ehre supposes that Übel will be killed by Wirbel, but Fern expresses doubt towards her claim.

## Episode Notes]

- The flashback Frieren has of the Hero Party occurs when Frieren sits by the fire at the campsite in the anime. However, in the manga, this flashback occurs during the conversation between Frieren and Kanne while they walk back to camp and before Kanne reveals her observation of the Stille to Frieren.
The sleep-talking between Kanne and Lawine and Frieren's subsequent agreement with Heiter's statement from the flashback is anime original.

- In the manga, Frieren thinks of the tribe of hunters who developed the original spell that captures a bird. This tribe is not shown in the anime.

- In the anime, Fern, Übel, and Land discuss hiding and getting water while taking shelter within a cave. In the manga, the group is already walking over the dried riverbed when they have the discussion.

- The confrontation between the fourth and eighth parties depicts the group members of each party facing off one-one-one in the anime. In the manga, the parties confront each other as a group.

- When Wirbel, Scharf, and Ehre ambush the fourth party, they are introduced as the eighth party in a similar manner to other parties introduced in the episode. However, in the manga, the eighth party is not introduced until the one-on-one battles begin in Chapter 41, and each member is introduced separately rather than altogether like other parties were.

- When the thirteenth party sees the bodies of the party killed by the Geisel, Denken touches the tree trunk and retracts his hand to find blood from the corpses on it. This scene is original to the anime.

## [ARCS] Episode 20
**Necessary Killing** ｢必 (ひつ) 要 (よう) な殺 (ころ) し, *Hitsuyō na koroshi*?｣ is the twentieth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on January 26, 2024. It is the fourth episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

The first-class mage exam intensifies as fighting breaks out between the participants - and what's at stake might even be worth killing for.

## Plot]

During the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam in the Grobe Basin, Übel faces off against Wirbel and cuts clean through falling trees with magic. As Wirbel defends against her attacks, he deduces that she is using a form of cleaving magic, though he struggles to follow its trajectory and is unable to block all of her attacks, which allows Übel to accrue cuts on his skin. However, Wirbel brings up the weakness of Übel's magic, which is that her range is limited to approximately five meters. Übel confirms Wirbel's deduction and wonders if they will continue fighting with such basic magic, but Wirbel tells her that there is no need.

Elsewhere on the battlefield, Fern and Ehre continue to face off, and Ehre internally repeats her remark that Wirbel's magic is devoid of character, underhanded, and focuses on winning, and Übel will likely be killed. As Ehre flies in the sky, Fern begins to cast a saturation attack consisting of a swarm of offensive magic, which forces Ehre to block each individual blast with defensive magic. However, Fern intensifies the speed of her casts, which begins to overwhelm Ehre. Ehre dubs Fern's attack as an absurd feat that she cannot handle, and her defensive magic is pressured inwards as she struggles to keep up with the relentless barrage. Ehre's defense ultimately collapses, and a large blast of mana lights up the forest.

Wirbel casts Sorganeil, which binds Übel with two rings of magic and forces her to fall to her knees. Übel notes that she cannot move, nor can she control her mana, and she concludes that with such a powerful binding spell at his disposal, Wirbel's party could easily catch a Stille, but the spell is useless if his party does not encounter a Stille to begin with. Wirbel explains to her that his magic binds anyone he keeps in his line of sight, and the requirement for his magic to work is that he cannot take his eyes off the target. However, as long as his magic is active, his target will not be able to move, and he can easily kill her now. Übel realizes that despite Wirbel stating that could kill her, Wirbel had actually taken it easy on her party during their earlier ambush, as he could have easily sealed their movements before striking them with offensive magic.

Wirbel dissipates the spell's binding and tells Übel to leave the Stille behind and escape. Übel finds the outcome boring, as she thought she finally had an opponent to fight to the death, but Wirbel's goal was just to extort her for the Stille. However, as she unclips the Stille's cage from her belt, Übel realizes that Wirbel should have easily been able to take the Stille from her while she was immobilized. She subsequently throws the caged Stille into the air, diverting Wirbel's attention, and she closes the distance between them, managing to cut the bridge of Wirbel's nose as he leaps back.

Wirbel immediately recasts Sorganeil, restricting Übel's movement. Unfazed, Übel deduces that Wirbel needs to keep her entire body in view to use Sorganeil, meaning he is unable to use his magic on multiple individuals. Wirbel responds that Übel aimed for his eyes, and Übel points out that it is rational to try to take away the vision of someone who requires sight to cast their magic. Wirbel counters that to settle the fight, Übel could have simply cut off his head. He references other opponents he met on the battlefield who acted similarly to Übel, and with disdain, he indicates that they were all degenerates who enjoyed killing. He then aims his staff at Übel's head, stating that he should kill her on the spot.

Übel bluntly asks if Wirbel has ever even killed women or children before, and Wirbel questions if she thinks he has not. Übel ponders what kind of hell Wirbel has gone through, and Wirbel calls Übel out on trying to buy time, but he decides to respond nonetheless. He tells Übel that the Northern Magic Corps consists of mercenaries that specialize in fighting demons, but in times of need, they are mobilized for wars between nations. As Wirbel recalls child soldiers approaching his line on a battlefield, he adds that sending women and children to war was not uncommon and such is the reality of the north. Übel states that she has heard enough, and for a moment, Wirbel stands motionless while towering over her, prompting Übel to ask if he is going to kill her or not.

Wirbel continues to hesitate, and Übel tells him that she believes the type of magic a person specializes in speaks greatly of their life and their character. Übel points out that Wirbel's magic, which restrains rather than kills, seems like it was designed to delay death rather than cause it. Wirbel grimaces, and Übel realizes that in answering her questions and joining her in buying time, Wirbel is fulfilling the same purpose of delaying death. She expresses surprise that despite his hands being stained with blood for so long, Wirbel still wishes to be human. Hearing this, Wirbel grins. He confirms Übel's analysis and tells her that his magic gives him time to build the resolve to kill, but also reveals that despite faltering and hesitating, he has never avoided an inevitable kill. With that being said, Wirbel begins to charge offensive magic point blank and tells Übel goodbye.

However, before Wirbel can kill Übel, he is interrupted by Fern demanding him to cease while aiming her staff at him. Wirbel pauses, expressing his surprise that Ehre was defeated and inwardly shocked that he did not sense Fern's approach at all. He voices that Fern's aptitude at mana concealment means that she must have been the one who captured her party's Stille. Fern does not respond, and Übel answers that they were just lucky to come across a Stille's nest, and Fern's master had taught her a spell that captures a bird. Übel then tells Wirbel that even though he has a spell that can capture anything, the odds were not in his favor, to which he agrees.

Wirbel asks Fern about what happened to Ehre, and Fern states that she killed her. Wirbel recites the conditions to pass, and he concludes that with a member gone, the eighth party has lost. He lifts his binding spell from Übel, and as he begins walking away, Übel asks why he has not killed her, given that was his original intention. He tells her that killing her would be unnecessary now that he has failed the exam, and he bids farewell. Übel directs her staff at Wirbel, which causes him to pause and tell her that if Übel were to attack him, an unnecessary kill would turn into a necessary kill. Übel lowers her staff, and when Wirbel is out of range, Übel tells Fern that she is a good liar. Fern does not respond, and she instead expresses to Übel that they should go and assist Land. Übel tells her that there is no need, as Land is quite the pretender.

Meanwhile, Land and Scharf fight in a meadow with blooming flowers. Scharf uses his spell, Jubelade, to turn the flower petals into blades of steel, which form an arrow-like swarm that cuts through Land's defensive spell, severely injuring his shoulder. Scharf declares that they have reached a verdict, and Land responds by observing Scharf's magic and deducing he is self-taught, which typically suggests that he is lacking in the fundamentals. Land then describes his own method of fighting, where he always makes sure to wait and see how an opponent fights. He tells Scharf that he has figured out his weakness, so he will be the likely victor. 

Scharf asks how Land intends to beat him, given his injuries, and he declares that if Land does not surrender, he will cut off his head next. Land recognizes that Scharf is not particularly good at detecting mana, and another Land suddenly appears from behind Scharf, catching him off-guard, and grabs his neck with one hand while the original Land fades. A surprised Scharf realizes Land was using illusion magic, but Land corrects him that his magic would be better classified as clone magic. Land proceeds to knock Scharf out with a spell that produces a small electric shock. After Scharf collapses, Land states that he has been using a clone since the beginning of the exam, as he does not trust other people.

In the forest, Wirbel discovers an unconscious Ehre. Wirbel recalls how Fern claimed she killed Ehre, and he voices his disbelief that Fern lied to him. He wakes up Ehre and scolds her for losing, as she was the top of her class at the Academy of Magic. Ehre tells him that Fern overwhelmed her with the sheer force of ordinary offensive magic, and she says that Wirbel probably does not believe her. Wirbel looks at the destruction of the environment around them, and he states that he does understand. Wirbel wonders why Ehre fought Fern head-on as he knew that it was a match she could have won, however, he recalls Fern's ambush on him as he was facing Übel, and he thinks to himself that she must be quite a monster for defeating Ehre with ordinary offensive magic.

Wirbel tells Ehre that they should regroup with Scharf, but Ehre says that she is unable to walk. In response, he casts a floating spell to levitate her, but Ehre protests and tells him to carry her instead, and an annoyed Wirbel relents. Wirbel and Ehre make their way to Scharf's location, where they find him collapsed and unable to move. Wirbel uses the levitation magic to carry Scharf as he and his party make their way through the forest. Wirbel laments their situation, as with only a few hours until sunset and with two members out of commission, their party has no way to take another party's Stille.

Ehre tells Wirbel that despite their situation, he still chose to help them. She also questions Wirbel if this kindness is why he fights demons, and she recalls a memory of herself as a young child, where Wirbel arrived to save her and her village from demons. Wirbel tells Ehre that people fight to satisfy their desires, and that in his case, he did it for a girl he liked in his hometown. He recalls how twenty-nine years ago, when he was four or five years old, the rise of demon activity in the Northern Lands led to the girl and her family to flee to the Central Lands. Right before they left, Wirbel declared that he would kill all the demons and that she should return after he is done. Wirbel reflects that he wanted to look cool in front of her and that he does not remember his crush's face or name anymore.

After hearing Wirbel's story, Ehre gently pokes fun at him, and Wirbel agrees that he was being a fool. Wirbel adds that he will have to return home by boat and laments the fact that he gets seasick. Ehre asks if she should introduce him to her grandfather, who is a first-class mage and could take Wirbel by land, but she abruptly cuts herself off and brings Wirbel's attention to a Stille perched on a tree. Wirbel proceeds to capture the bird with Sorganeil, making it fall to the ground. Wirbel approaches the bird and wonders what the point of all their previous efforts was, and he adds that it took way too long for them to get lucky.

Meanwhile, as Laufen confronts the second party, Denken observes from afar and judges that Frieren is a skilled mage. He also notes that Laufen's magic will not work again after Frieren has already witnessed it once. Laufen proceeds to vanish, surprising Kanne, and Lawine points out that their Stille is suddenly gone, which Frieren confirms. Laufen hides behind a tree while holding the second party's Stille, and she uses her spell once again to escape. Frieren picks up on this action and expresses that Laufen is using an interesting spell.

On a cliff in the Grobe Basin, first-class mage and exam proctor Genau observes the examinees. First-class mage Sense suddenly appears besides him, and she remarks that it is comfortable inside the barrier even during the rain. Genau recalls that Sense is the proctor for the second exam, and Sense responds that Genau has once again become responsible for the deaths of many promising candidates. Genau disregards her concern and points out that promising examinees would not die during the exam, which makes first-class mages all the more valuable.

As a Stille lands on Sense, she criticizes Genau for selecting a target immune to mana detection, as catching one would come down to luck and teams would be forced to battle. Genau tells Sense that luck is a skill in itself, and some examinees managed to catch a Stille without relying on luck. Genau then shares with Sense that sunset is in three hours, meaning that the battles will get more intense. Sense asks him on his thoughts on how many examinees will pass, and Genau estimates that a third will remain. He adds that he believes that Denken will be among those who pass, since he is almost as capable as a first-class mage. Sense claims that Denken is only interested in money and power and concludes that if someone like him is participating now, he must be after the privilege. Genau also voices his uncertainty behind Denken's motivation but decides that he likely has his reasons.

In the meantime, Denken and Richter confront the second party. Frieren asks them if Laufen was using Jilwer, which she describes as folk magic originating from a mountain tribe in the Southern Lands, and Denken confirms her guess. Kanne asks about Jilwer, and Lawine explains that it is a high-speed movement spell. Frieren tells the men of the other party that they should have stayed hidden, as Laufen could have simply stolen the Stille and escaped. Denken points out that Laufen is still a novice and has left too many traces of her mana, and he believes that the elf could have tracked her down easily, calling Frieren by her name.

Frieren expresses surprise that he knows who she is, and Denken tells her that her name is famous among his generation and that even though this was his first time seeing her in person, he was sure of her identity the moment he saw her. Kanne wonders about Frieren's reputation to Lawine, and Lawine confirms that Frieren is a legendary mage, but she was unsure until now. Frieren asks why Denken's team chose to confront her directly, even with the knowledge of her identity, as she expected more underhanded tactics.

Richter comes forward and disagrees, revealing that while Frieren fights Denken, he will kill either Kanne or Lawine. Frieren notes that their strategy makes sense, as the cannot pass if they lose a party member. The two parties prepare to fight, but Denken interrupts and tells Richter that they just need to hold the other party off. Richter states that he expected Denken to be more ruthless as an Imperial Mage who likely eliminated many of his political opponents. Denken thinks back to his time as an Imperial Mage, and he says that he does not think becoming a first-class mage is worth someone's life, which Frieren agrees with, stating that "first-class mage" is simply a title.

Richter is astonished at Frieren's claim and questions why she decided to take the exam without knowing about the privilege. He brings up that over half a century ago, Great Mage Serie, the founder of the Continental Magic Association, established the first-class mage rank to seek out the accomplished mages from the war against the Demon King. He adds that as an incentive, Serie began offering a special privilege to those who achieved the rank: she would bestow upon them any single spell that they desired. Richter continues that Serie is a living grimoire who knows nearly every spell known to humanity, and she is the mage that is most closely comparable to the omniscient and omnipotent Goddess. He compares the privilege to granting one's dream, and as a result, first-class mages seem like inhuman monsters. Denken calls this mindset ridiculous, and Richter retorts that Denken is part of the minority that does not care about the privilege. 

Richter then signals Denken for them to begin fighting. Richter asks Denken to keep Frieren occupied while he kills the other two members of her party. Denken reminds Richter that he does not need to kill them as they are just kids, and he simply needs to keep them occupied while he defeats Frieren. Richter relents and casts a earth control spell, Bargland, which separates and raises the ground with him, Kanne, and Lawine from Frieren and Denken. Now alone, Frieren and Denken prepare to face off against each other.

## [ARCS] Episode 21
**The World of Magic** ｢魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) の世 (せ) 界 (かい) , *Mahō no sekai*?｣ is the twenty-first episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on February 2, 2024. It is the fifth episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

Frieren, Kanne, and Lawine struggle with the 13th party over possession of the Stille, but there'll be more surprises in store before their battle, and the first test, reach their conclusion.

## Plot]

As rain falls on the magic barrier that encompasses the test area in the Grobe Basin, Denken and Richter prepare to fight the second party. Richter casts Bargland, an earth control spell, which separates the earth and creates a mesa with the raised ground holding him, Kanne, and Lawine away from Frieren and Denken. Denken tells Frieren that the young are too hot-blooded and calls the privilege for becoming a first-class mage nonsense, which prompts Frieren to inquire why he thinks so. Denken responds that the greatest joy of magic lies in the search for it. 

Some time ago, Frieren and Flamme visited Serie at her ancient hall. When they arrived and kneeled before her, Serie greeted her apprentice and mused about how time flies as the apprentice she raised on a whim had found herself an apprentice of her own. Flamme introduced Frieren to Serie, and Serie pointed out that Frieren is an elf like her and she liked her already, as Frieren must be strong. She then told Frieren that she would grant any spell that she desired, as she claimed to have the knowledge of practically any grimoire ever written and mages spend their lives in pursuit of magic. Frieren refused her offer, stating that the pursuit of magic itself was the greatest joy.

After hearing Frieren's response, Serie addressed Flamme and told her that Frieren was no good, as she lacked ambition. Flamme replied that Frieren would defeat the Demon King one day, and she believed that a mage like her would open the path to a new era of peace. Serie questioned if Flamme was saying that she could not, and Flamme reminded Serie that she was a warmongerer and wondered if Serie could even imagine herself living in an era of peace, whereas Frieren was a mage who belonged to a peaceful era. In the present, Frieren approves of Denken's answer and states that mages should have that mindset.

Meanwhile, Kanne and Lawine face Richter. Lawine tries to freeze Richter with a spell, but it is ineffective against him, and Lawine speculates that the difference in their mana is too large. She then attempts to attack him with her spell Nephtear, hurling arrows of ice at Richter. Richter blocks the arrows by casting a defensive shell of earth around himself. He calls Lawine's attack weak and proceeds to cast his own spell, which creates stalagmites that rise from the ground. Lawine shouts at Kanne to defend them, and Kanne complies, casting defensive magic. After the attack, Richter tells Kanne and Lawine that he more or less knows their capabilities, and he describes the pair as a mage with ice magic that lacks lethality and a mage that is useless in a fight without access to water. He continues defending against Lawine's ice magic with earth and complains that he is doing nothing more than babysitting. 

After Kanne defends against another one of Richter's attacks, Lawine mockingly thanks Richter for the insight and adds her own observation that Richter will run out of mana if he continues casting flashy spells. Richter asks if the two of them are from the magic school and if their seniors are still teaching them to fight battles of attrition with mostly defensive spells. When Kanne asks what he means, Richter begins to give them a lecture on the history of magic. He tells them that the defensive magic that was created to counter Zoltraak provides great resistance to magic itself, but its defensive quality against attacks using mass has not changed much until now. He states that the reason for this is that the spell's defense was enough against physical attacks from monsters or warriors, and aiming to perfect and subsequently further complicate the spell to work against stronger physical attacks would be disadvantageous for its casting speed. He concludes that the history of magic is one of attacking and defending and that there is a reason modern attack spells favor the control of physical objects.

Richter proceeds to conjure a stalagmite from underneath Kanne and Lawine. Kanne attempts to defend, but the spell easily pierces through her shield and sends both girls into the air. Richter iterates that his spells overwhelm defensive magic with high-volume physical attacks and requests them to stay down, as he does not intend to kill them. However, they both draw themselves up, and Lawine asks if Richter should be approaching them so carelessly, as sixty percent of a human's body consists of water. Richter responds that the world of magic is of visual imagination and asks if they can picture the distribution of water in the body while also considering how to remove and manipulate it. He adds that a mage like him is also protected by a high amount of mana and that even if water was present, Kanne is not a threat to him. Lawine sighs that not even bluffing works, but she brings up that Richter is lying, as if he had been unconcerned about Kanne's water manipulation magic, he would have beaten them somewhere with water around given that he enjoyed lecturing about magic. Richter refuses to address her remark but instead requests again that they should behave while Denken fights Frieren.

In the meantime, Frieren and Denken engage in combat while using flying magic. Frieren casts multiple beams of offensive magic that hone in and follow Denken while he makes evasive maneuvers. Denken realizes that he can not sustain this battle and she will eventually exhaust his mana with how they are currently fighting. He lands on the ground and apologizes in advance for what he is about to do. He proceeds to cast his spell Waldgose, which engulfs the elf in a tornado, and he follows up with his spell Daosdorg, which turns the tornado into a flaming whirlwind. The blaze of fire bumps into the magic barrier surrounding the test area, which astonishes Kanne and Lawine and prompts Richter to ask what the old man is doing. At the proctor observation site, Genau comments that Denken's fighting style is rather sensational. Sense asks if the barrier will hold, but an unconcerned Genau brings up that the barrier was erected by the Great Mage Serie and cannot be destroyed simply by force. Sense notes that somebody began analyzing the barrier the day before, which intrigues Genau, but he retorts that such an endeavor is a waste of time and asks Sense if she thinks there is any mage that can surpass Serie. 

At the battlefield, Denken watches as Frieren outlasts his tornado by surrounding herself in a sphere of defensive magic. Denken attacks her with his Catastravia spell, sending a barrage of arrows of light at her defensive shield. During his continuous volley of arrows, he is distracted by a single counterattack of offensive magic that he has to block, shifting his focus and leaving an opening for Frieren to close the distance. Frieren casts Zoltraak at point-blank, which blasts Denken onto the ground while producing a path of desolation.

When Frieren approaches him, Denken draws himself up and says that he is out of mana. He expresses his disbelief that she only used ordinary combat magic until the end, and he compares his fight with her to a practice session for a novice mage. Denken tells the elf that he is surprised that there was someone who surpassed his level, but Frieren does not respond and instead asks where Laufen is hiding. She aims her staff at him, but Denken refuses to cooperate. Frieren proceeds to step on Denken and proclaim loudly that she knows Laufen is nearby, and unless Laufen gives back the Stille, she will kill her teammate. However, Denken implores Laufen not to comply with Frieren's demands, as Frieren does not intend to kill him.

As Laufen hides behind a tree, she thinks to herself that Denken was beaten by Frieren, but although Frieren is a better mage than both her and Richter, she concludes that the elf underestimates them. Denken requests Laufen to stay hidden and avoid using Jilwer, but she disregards his request and casts Jilwer to grab him and flee. However, Frieren catches her, and Denken scolds Laufen for getting caught.

Frieren takes back her party's Stille and binds Denken and Laufen to a tree with restraint magic. Denken tells Laufen that Frieren did not intend to kill him, but the young mage replies that she at least would have made him suffer. Denken says that even so, they would have won this way, which prompts Laufen to ask why he is so desperate to become a first-class mage as he is already in possession of wealth, influence, and everything else one could think of. Denken recalls a sight of his homeland and tells her that his home is located deep in the Northern Plateau, and he wanted to visit a grave. However, due to demon activity in the region, the prerequisite to travel there is to be a first-class mage. Denken then asks Frieren if she should go help Kanne and Lawine, though he adds that perhaps it is already too late, as Richter will kill them before he faces the elf. However, Frieren responds that they will be fine and adds that she has just finished analyzing the barrier.

On top of the mesa, Richter says to himself that he did not expect Denken to lose and tells Kanne and Lawine that he is done babysitting. Now with the intent to kill, Richter creates stalagmites, one of which blocks Lawine's Nephtear ice shards and falls in their direction, with Kanne and Lawine narrowly escaping it. Lawine realizes that Richter is attacking them with the intent to kill and they will not last long against him.

Back at the tree, Laufen asks what Frieren meant by analyzing the barrier and Denken realizes what Frieren is about to do. Frieren proceeds to perform a casting sequence which aims a cone of light upwards. Sense watches the scene and notifies Genau, but he is insistent that it is impossible for the barrier to break. However, the barrier shatters, letting in the rain from outside the exam grounds. Genau inquires Sense about the identity of the elf, and Sense replies that her name is Frieren. Genau recognizes the name as the mage who traveled with the party of heroes, and Sense adds that Frieren apparently had a Holy Emblem, which prompts Genau to comment that she is the last Great Mage. Meanwhile, Serie sits on the throne in her ancient hall and expresses that Frieren is greeting her in such a way after a millennium has passed. She notes to herself that it is why she cannot quit being a mage, as in the world of magic, even the world can turn upside down.

At the tree, Laufen asks Frieren why she destroyed the barrier, and Frieren answers that she felt sorry for Kanne, as a mage should be able to use magic freely. Denken recalls that Kanne could manipulate water and Frieren replies that magic is a world of visualization. She asks if he can imagine defeating a mage who controls water in the rain and asserts that she herself would be unable to so, which should be the same for Richter.

On top the mesa, all three mages look upwards in surprise at the rain, with Richter being the first to recollect himself, and he figures he can learn what happened later. He touches the ground in preparation to cast a spell, but his hand is frozen to the ground by Lawine. She comments that he is panicking, which disrupts his mana. A massive sphere of water forms over him, and Lawine points out that Richter was afraid of Kanne's water manipulation, as it is the perfect example of a high-volume physical attack. Kanne commands Lawine to not let him get away, and Lawine complies by freezing his feet to the ground. Kanne casts Reamstroha, directing the sphere of water towards Richter. The sphere presses down on Richter's defensive magic, and as his shield cracks, he states that this is exactly why he hates water. The water engulfs him and spills over the top of the mesa in a flood. 

As the wave of water reaches the tree, Frieren flies away to the top of the mesa, where just Kanne and Lawine are left. She congratulates them on their victory and tells them they should leave, as the sun sets in about two hours. Frieren requests that they hide their mana in the meantime, and Lawine replies that they both have none left to conceal. Frieren praises them, which pleases Kanne and irritates Lawine.

In the meantime, Richter is washed to the tree and caught by Denken. Richter apologizes for his defeat, but Denken says that it was inevitable. Richter attempts to free Laufen and Denken's binds, but he gives up shortly after remarking that he and Denken have no mana left. Denken asks Laufen to undo the binding, but she claims it is too powerful. He tells her to cut down the tree instead, and she complies, releasing them. With Denken and Laufen free, Richter questions what they should do now with the impending time limit, and Laufen adds that she does not have enough mana left to use Jilwer. Denken says that an Imperial Mage would fight until the end, and he proposes that they search for signs of battle and track down other parties.

Inside a cave, Übel calls Fern boring for only casting ordinary offensive magic. Fern replies that she should complain to Frieren. Übel then goes on to say that her master is at fault for her to be soaking wet from the rain and Fern should scold her. As Fern lights up a small campfire, she tells Übel that she intends to do just that and adds that her master does not restrict what spells she uses outside of combat. Übel recalls that Fern used a spell to catch birds and asks what other magic she can cast. Fern thinks for a short moment and then says that she has a spell that allows her to see through clothes and adds that she will not use it when Übel widens the gap between them. Land interrupts their talk and suggests that they should not reveal too much, as from the second test onward, they will be competing against each other. Übel concedes, but she tells Land that he should open up to them more.

From a bush, Denken, Laufen, and Richter observe two mages holding on to a caged Stille. Denken comments that they are a defeated party and the corpse of their third member was nearby. Richter asks if they should negotiate, but Denken believes that they would not agree to negotiatons, even though they are not eligible to pass, and he would not accept negotiations either if he was in a similar circumstance. Laufen asks why, and Denken responds that it would not sit right with him. Denken rises from the bushes, telling Laufen to wait for an opportunity to take the Stille, and he informs Richter to follow him. Richter reminds Denken that they are out of mana, but Denken replies that the other party is in the same situation. Denken approaches the party, removes his cloak, and casts his fists towards the other party while exclaiming they will settle things with a fistfight.

As sunset approaches, the remaining parties wrap up the exam. Frieren, Kanne, and Lawine set up a campsite, Übel, Fern, and Land wait in the cave, Wirbel carries Ehre on his back while floating Scharf, Laufen bandages Denken with Richter and a caged Stille beside them, a male and female mage attempt to catch a Stille that has landed on their third teammate, and a party walks past three incapacitated mages.

In the evening, the parties reconvene at Genau's campsite. Genau states that the first test has concluded and six parties, consisting of eighteen individuals, have passed. He goes on to say that the second test will take place in three days and all of the successful examinees will be informed of the details later. He then dismisses the examinees.

In a bar in Äußerst, Stark says that it has been two days since Frieren and Fern left for the exam, and he utters that he can stay up as late as he wants since Fern is not around to get mad at him. He expresses that he is so happy that it scares him. The barkeeper comforts him and says that it sounds like he has it rough.

## Episode Notes]

- When Richter lectures Kanne and Lawine about defensive magic, he casts defensive magic and modifies the structure and shape of it when describing the reason why it is less effective against physical attacks. These modifications are original to the anime, as the manga does not show him changing the structure of the defensive magic.

- Before Richter is washed towards Denken and Laufen, there are two additional scenes with a Geisel and a presumed victim of the Geisel in a tree that are unique to the anime. Additionally, Richter's attempt to undo the binding magic Frieren casted to fixate Laufen and Denken to the tree is an extra scene included in the anime.

## [ARCS] Episode 22
**Future Enemies** ｢次 (つぎ) からは敵 (てき) 同 (どう) 士 (し) , *Tsugi kara wa tekidōshi*?｣ is the twenty-second episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on February 9, 2024. It is the sixth episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1. A fifth PV for the anime was released along with the episode.

## Synopsis]

After the conclusion of the first test, the exam participants have some time to kill in town. What do mages get up to on their days off?

## Plot]

The first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam concludes with six parties having successfully captured and defended a Stille, resulting in eighteen individuals continuing on to the next stage, including Frieren and Fern. Genau notifies them that the next exam will take place in three days and dismisses them.

The next evening, Stark lazes in bed at the inn. He receives a violent knock on the door and opens it to discover Frieren and Fern, having returned the previous night. Fern questions if Stark was asleep, to which he reluctantly admits, and additionally acknowledges that he drank juice at night. Fern beats him angrily as he profusely apologizes, and she points out that Frieren woke up late as well. Frieren and Stark think of methods to cheer Fern up, and Frieren proposes they eat, using her savings, at a restaurant that she and the Hero Party discovered during a prior visit.

In another part of Äußerst, Richter manages a magic shop, where he fixes an old lady's lamp. She thanks him and hands him candy. As Richter watches her leave, he is approached by Denken and Laufen, prompting him to tell them that his shop is closed as he needs to rest after being dragged into a fistfight by an old man. Denken invites Richter out to eat, and Richter follows up by questioning what Laufen was doing with Denken and why she was holding a basket of sweets. She responds that Denken bought them for her and did not intend to share, to which Richter asks if she just suddenly became Denken's granddaughter. Richter tells the pair to leave as they no longer have any reason to associate with each other, and Denken reminds him that as a mage, being associated with him may be a good idea. Richter informs them that there are many restaurants in the area they can pick from, but Denken insists and reveals the restaurant he was looking for was one he dined at with his late wife. Hearing this, Richter decides to accept the invite and expects Denken to pay.

Land passes through an alley and spots a kitten and its mother, though they flee after seeing him. Übel calls out to him and comments on him not using a clone when in town. He asks if they can walk while chatting, which Übel accepts, but she reminds him that she might kill him if he chooses to run. During their conversation, Land asks why Übel chose not to kill Wirbel in the first stage given that she feels no guilt towards killing. She notes that he must have watched their duel and tells him that it was likely due to the fact that she could empathize with Wirbel, specifically regarding his desire to delay a kill. She then uses Sorganeil to hold Land in place and reveals that she can copy another individual's magic if she is capable of empathizing with them, as a person's magic specialization is intertwined with their life and character. She expresses her curiosity towards Land and wonders what kind of life he has lived, given his clones are perfect replicas of himself. Land realizes that Übel is the type of person to use magic purely based on feel and without understanding the actual workings behind it, expressing his distaste for such individuals. He refuses to answer Übel's questions and tells her that if she were to kill him, she would never be able to empathize with him. She decides to free him and states that she is beginning to understand him and wants to continue doing so, then proceeds to follow him.

Denken, Richter, and Laufen arrive at the restaurant, and Richter praises Denken for his taste as the restaurant is the best in town. Denken tells them that although the last time he visited was over fifty years ago with his wife, it still feels identical. Upon entering, they notice Frieren, Fern, and Stark ordering, and Denken tells Richter to leave them be as they should be free to enjoy the food there, and they are at the restaurant for the same reason. 

Frieren and her party receive their food, which immediately cheers Fern up. Frieren receives a massive plate of meat, and she reflects back on her previous dining experience at the establishment with the Hero Party, where the head chef, Lecker, thanked them for retrieving his heirloom knife from demons and promised them the greatest hospitality and reward he could. Frieren ordered a giant plate of meat, which she reasoned was due to her need to savor the taste, as she had frequently been unable to experience the same tastes. Lecker reassured her that the taste at his restaurant will never change, even in the next century or two, but she claimed that chefs say that yet try to leave their mark on dishes and change the flavor. Himmel told her that she could just search for something that tasted even better, and he requested that Lecker guarantee that no flavors will ever surpass his own as their reward.

Fern and Stark excitedly comment on the taste of their food, and when Frieren tries her own, she comments that the taste did, in fact, change. However, she happily notes that she no longer has to pursue better flavors, as her current meal tastes much better than during her previous visit. Now cheery, Fern happily leads the way back to the inn as Frieren laments the depletion of her savings.

During an afternoon, Stark meditates on a cliff outside of Äußerst. An old man stands beside him and tells him that he has nothing left to teach him, leaving Stark alone. Frieren comes up to him and asks who the man was, to which Starks responds that he does not know him. Frieren requests for his help with Fern, who is furious with Frieren for oversleeping and elects to ignore both Frieren and Fern's attempts at communication. She later mentions her desire to eat snacks, to which Frieren and Stark comply.

Kanne observes the hustle of the city from the forecourt of the Continental Magic Association and notices Wirbel scouting out a warrior with Scharf. Lawine shows up in a fancy dress, which she complains is due to her brothers and mother dressing her up upon her brothers returning from the imperial capital with gifts. Kanne teases Lawine, which results in Lawine sitting on her back and pulling on her pigtails. They head to a bakery, where they find Frieren and Stark struggling to pick something of Fern's liking.

Kanne and Lawine join up with Frieren's party and head towards the latter's inn, and Frieren introduces them to Stark as her teammates during the first stage of the exam. On their way, Wirbel and Scharf encounter them and receive Fern's permission to take Stark away to deal with a Fresser per a request by the Continental Magic Association, though Stark himself is unenthusiastic.

At the inn, Kanne offers Frieren a basket of treats to thank her for her help on the first exam. Her words of thanks remind Frieren of how Himmel would frequently aid others and change their lives for the better, even on a small scale, as a way for him to be remembered. Frieren smiles as she watches Kanne, Lawine, and Fern chat and is relieved when Fern's mood improves upon trying the sweets Kanne gifted. Lawine comments on Frieren's inability to wake up during the exam, and Frieren requests that she does not talk about it, lest Fern gets angry again.

Lawine informs Frieren that the exam typically consists of three stages and tells her that they will likely be enemies in the next exam, right as they receive a letter detailing the second exam from a messenger bird. The letter provides the location, date, and proctor for the exam, Sense. Lawine and Kanne comment on their bad luck, as the four exams Sense proctored in the past had no successful examinees. The other candidates receive the letters, and Stark and Wirbel bond while feasting on Fresser meat. Genau and Sense discuss the exam and Genau comments that the exam is rather cruel, however, Sense reminds him that she is a pacifist unlike him.

## Locations in Order of Appearance]

- Grobe Basin

- Äußerst
Northern branch of the Continental Magic Association 

- Kühl Region

- Ruins of the King's Tomb

## Episode Notes]

- The anime includes several original names for various locations around Äußerst:
"Swallow Inn" for the inn Frieren's Party stays in.

- "Bell" for the restaurant that various parties visit during the intermission between the first and second exam stages.

- "Sun Bakery" for the pastry shop where Frieren, Fern, Stark, Kanne, and Lawine visit.

- When Fern scolds Stark for having juice at night, the drink is depicted twice in the manga: the cover of Chapter 40, where Stark sees it being sold at a market, and the cover of Chapter 46, where Stark consumes the beverage at the inn.

- In the anime, Richter receives sugar cubes from the old lady. This is different from the manga, where he instead receives a wrapped round candy.

- The anime includes a short original scene: when Land walks through an alley, he discovers a kitten and its mother. The cats flee from him, potentially implying that his current body is not real but rather a clone.

- While at the Bell restaurant, Frieren recommends a dish to Stark. This dish—which resembles omurice—is implied to be the same dish that Himmel ordered during the Hero Party's visit to the same restaurant (however, he is pictured with a different dish in the manga). Laufen also orders this same dish.

- In the anime, Wirbel states that the request to subjugate the Fresser came from the Continental Magic Association, while in the manga, it is not explicitly stated.

- In the flashback where a young girl is saved by Himmel, she runs to her parents in the anime, but in the manga, the girl is depicted to be alone.

- The anime includes the full text of what is written on the letter detailing the second exam to the examinees. In the manga, Fern and Lawine simply summarize the contents.

- In the manga, Stark is shown fighting the Fresser solo as Wirbel and Scharf receive the letters detailing the second exam. In the anime, this scene is removed and instead, Scharf is shown reading the letter as Wirbel and Stark eat the Fresser meat.
Additionally, this scene in the anime is placed before the scene where Genau and Sense discuss the exam, while the manga has it placed after.

- In the manga, Methode is implied to have either knocked out or killed the messenger bird that delivers the letter. In the anime, she is shown to be holding it by its tail feathers as it struggles to escape.

- The ending card of the episode depict an old lady telling a story about the Hero Party defeating a monster through finger puppets. The old lady might be the young girl that Himmel saved, as the finger puppet associated with the monster has a similar appearance to the actual monster that was defeated to save her.

## [ARCS] Episode 23
**Conquering the Labyrinth** ｢迷 (めい) 宮 (きゅう) 攻 (こう) 略 (りゃく) , *Meikyū kōryaku*?｣ is the twenty-third episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on February 16, 2024. It is the seventh episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

The aspiring first-class mages now face their second test: conquering the Ruins of the King's Tomb. A simple task, or so the proctor claims, but there's a reason this particular dungeon remains unexplored.

## Plot]

First-class mage Sense and the eighteen examinees that passed the first stage of the First-Class Mage Exam gather at the entrance of the Ruins of the King's Tomb for the second stage. Sense, the proctor of the exam, explains that although her exams have historically shown low success rates and speculation regarding the difficulty of her next exam has been brought up, their task is simple and should be feasible for any future first-class mages. She delivers their assignment, which is to raid the Ruins of the King's Tomb, a dungeon, and to make it to the innermost depths. As she is a pacifist, Sense clarifies that anyone that successfully reaches the bottom will pass. Blei questions if Sense intends for every examinee to fail given that the tomb has never been cleared, but Sense responds that any first-class mage should be able to achieve what is considered impossible and move forward, even in unexplored territory. Methode asks what they should do to prove their success, to which Sense reveals that she will be accompanying them, however, she will not provide any form of aid. Sense then supplies each candidate with a bottled escape golem developed by Lernen and instructs them to break the bottle to escape in the event they cannot continue, as she does not wish for promising mages to die. Additionally, she discloses that breaking the bottle will result in an automatic failure, and the bottles will break at dawn of the next day, signifying their time limit.

The candidates discuss their strategies for the exam, and Denken proposes they work together. Ton refuses, as there is no incentive to keep their teammates alive unlike the first exam, and cooperating is a risk that could lead to individuals being sacrificed. He voices his distrust for Denken specifically, as he appears to have experience with dungeons, and elects to go in on his own. Edel, Dünste, and Blei also choose to go as an individual group, followed by Wirbel, Scharf, and Ehre. Frieren and Fern are the next to enter, as Frieren believes that cooperating as a large group is no longer feasible. Sense follows them, believing them to be the safest to accompany.

Frieren leads Fern and Sense through the dungeon, with Fern mapping it out as they go along. Fern comments on Frieren's vast knowledge of dungeons, which Frieren attributes to Himmel's past enjoyment and excitement towards them. She thinks back to her time in the Hero Party, where Himmel would constantly insist on mapping out every corner of a dungeon before proceeding forward. His actions puzzled Eisen and Frieren, and Himmel explained that it is best to enjoy themselves, as the journey he desires is one that consists of enjoying their adventure while also saving the world.

Back at the entrance, Kanne and Lawine enter the dungeon together, leaving Denken, Richter, Laufen, Methode, and Länge as the final five examinees on the surface. Denken criticizes the other examinees who went in for not choosing to cooperate, as they could have easily cleared the dungeon together. Richter reminds Denken that not everyone thinks the same way as him and that they probably did not favor such a strategy. He tells Denken to think of themselves as the brighter individuals who chose to stay and that none of the remaining members would be foolish enough to fall for simple traps.

Frieren and her group arrive at a room, where Frieren observes a chest's mana. She concludes that there may be a grimoire inside, but Fern warns her that the spell to analyze treasure chests, Mikheit, revealed it to be a mimic. Frieren responds that the spell is only 99% accurate, and historic discoveries were made by those that considered the 1%. Feeling certain about the presence of a grimoire, Frieren opens the chest, and she is immediately eaten by the mimic. Fern attempts to pull her out to no avail, and Sense observes the interaction, wondering if she made the wrong decision to follow them.

Denken leads his group through the dungeon, and they come across a room with two gargoyle statues. The gargoyles activate, resulting in a confrontation between them and the mages. They engage in battle, with Methode defeating one of the gargoyles by returning its attack. Laufen bashes another one to the ground, however, it manages to release an attack at Länge. Länge attempts to block it with defensive magic, but the force of it flings her back into a room that immediately closes and activates walls of spikes that move toward her. Denken manages to defeat the other gargoyle and attempts to free Länge from the room by attacking the sealed wall with Catastravia, but he is unsuccessful. With no other option, Denken instructs Länge to break her bottle and she complies, releasing the golem. The golem pushes apart the walls and breaks Länge out of the room, carrying her on its shoulder and bringing her back to the surface. The remaining four examinees witness the wreckage, and Denken realizes that letting their guards down for even the slightest moment could result in their deaths.

Fern continues attempting to free Frieren from the mimic, without much success. Frieren suggests she push her deeper into the mimic to make it gag, which should force her out, and Fern does as told, rescuing her from the mimic. Fern wonders how Frieren would escape if she got stuck without anyone to help her, and Frieren describes that she would typically blow them up from the inside, though she preferred not to use this method as the resulting explosion would turn her hair into ringlet curls. They continue traversing the dungeon, with Frieren making them explore every corner. Fern notices that their expedition is going oddly smoothly, and Frieren agrees, considering the dungeon is uncharted and that they are close to the depths. She tells her not to let her guard down and initializes a break, where she marvels at the treasure they discovered.

While they observe Frieren, Sense wonders how Fern is able to be so talented at her age, despite not showing any passion or obsession. Fern responds that she likely exhausted all her passion when she was young, where she trained tirelessly to become a full-fledged mage as repayment to someone dear to her. Sense asks why she continues pursuing magic, and Fern refers to Frieren's delight when discovering magic and magical items. As Fern also felt joy when witnessing this, she desired to continue pursuing magic so she could continue seeing her master happy. Sense smiles and acknowledges that she was right to follow Frieren and Fern after all, as they could find joy exploring even a cruel dungeon. As they continue on, a monster awakens in the depths.

As Wirbel, Scharf, and Ehre proceed down the dungeon, Ehre becomes restrained by Sorganeil. She detects and mentions the presence of three concealed mages to her team members, and they are subsequently attacked. Scharf guards them with Jubelade, and Wirbel notices that their attackers consist of their clones. He notes that this must be why the Ruins of the King's Tomb have never been conquered and instructs Scharf to match up against his clone, Ehre against Scharf's clone, and himself against Ehre's clone.

Elsewhere, Denken's group fights against a clone of Laufen and manages to defeat it. They analyze the clone and discover it to be a near-perfect replica made of magic with the same level of mana and skill as the real Laufen, though it is easily identifiable as a clone. Methode points out that if the caster of the clones can control multiple ones simultaneously, it must be a major threat, and Denken expresses that teaming up was the correct choice to make in order to have multiple options to deal with them. They approach a door and enter, arriving in a large room where a clone of Frieren descends. When Richter asks if they are capable of dealing with it, Denken acknowledges that had this not been an exam, he would have broken his bottle long ago, and the four mages prepare for battle.

## Episode Notes]

- The initial scene where Sense refers to the speculation surrounding the exam does not occur in the manga.

- In the manga, when Sense hands out the bottled escape golems, she pictures herself being carried over the shoulder by one, but this is not adapted in the anime.

- In the dungeon that Frieren visited with the Hero Party, the party was at an open air floor, but in the manga, the party appeared to be at a lower level with tunnels.

- The sequence where Denken and his team members fight against the gargoyles is extended in the episode and shows Methode defeating the first gargoyle instead of Laufen, who defeated the first gargoyle in the manga. The scene where Denken's group fights against Laufen's clone is also extended and depicts Methode casting the final blow.
The gargoyles in the manga are depicted to fight with physical attacks, but the anime shows them casting a red beam of offensive magic. Subsequently, the spell that Methode casts to reflect this magic is an anime-only addition as well.

- The Spiegel awakening is an original scene in the anime.

## [ARCS] Episode 24
**Perfect Replicas** ｢完 (かん) 璧 (ぺき) な複 (ふく) 製 (せい) 体 (たい) , *Kanpeki na fukuseitai*?｣ is the twenty-fourth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on February 23, 2024. It is the eighth episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

Due to the Spiegel, a legendary monster that can create perfect replicas of others, the test-takers who would conquer the Ruins of the King's Tomb must first face the ultimate enemy: themselves.

## Plot]

In a study room at the Continental Magic Association, Genau explains to Falsch that the lord of the Ruins of the King's Tomb is referred to as the Spiegel, a monster from the mythical era that appeared in Ewig the Sage's heroic tales. He explains that the Spiegel reads memories and creates perfect replicas of those who enter the dungeon and compares it with the modern era Einsam, but the Spiegel's replicas have physical substance and mirror the targets' abilities, mana, and skills. Genau adds that this is why the Ruins of the King's Tomb remains unconquered. Falsch wonders why Sense would choose such a place for the exam, and Genau responds that the clones are perfect matches for their opponents, so to defeat them without losing anyone, the examinees have to calmly analyze themselves and cooperate as a team. He concludes that the test is one only a pacifist like Sense would devise.

At the Ruins of the King's Tomb, Denken's group prepares to face Frieren's clone, who descends to the floor of the hall and starts casting offensive magic. Denken calls for them retreat, and the mages flee the clone's barrage of attacks, taking cover outside. Denken observes the clone around the corner and wonders how they should proceed.

Meanwhile, Übel and Land are trapped at a dead end in the dungeon, and a replica of Übel stands around the corner. Land is badly wounded, with his bottled escape golem in the hands of Übel's clone. Übel asks Land about how perfect her replica is, given he is an expert in cloning magic, and Land responds that Übel enjoys talking during combat but her replica is silent. She wonders if that means the clone does not have her memories or personality, but Land disagrees and says that it is likely just unable to speak. He recalls the clone's initial attack, where it slashed his chest and stole his escape golem, and Übel comments that she would have done the same thing. Land then speculates that the clone has information about them as well and is cautious of Übel's Sorganeil spell. Übel jokes to an unamused Land that instead of being cautious, maybe the clone just enjoys toying with them. Übel notices that Land is bleeding out, and she tells him that he will not last long. She also asks him if he is really the original Land, or if he is using one of his clones. Land gives her a vague response, and Übel brings out her escape golem bottle, telling him to use it. Land refuses and says her golem is meant for her survival. Übel leaves the bottle next to him and tells him to wait while she gets his bottle back.

Before Land can stop her, Übel charges around the corner, and both she and her clone close the gap between them. She recalls that the condition to use Sorganeil is to see the target's whole body, and since they are equal in strength, the fight will depend on luck. The two of them fight in synchronicity, occasionally mirroring their attacks, which makes their slashes collide with each other and deflect onto the walls. Übel notes that she hates fights that depend on luck as luck has never favored her. 

They continue to clash, but when Übel attempts to slash her clone, it blocks her and catches Übel with Sorganeil. Übel laments that she was unlucky, however, she tells the clone that it was even unluckier. Übel calls out to Land, who has just appeared behind the clone, and exclaims that he was faster than expected. The clone abruptly turns, disabling Sorganeil, and Übel takes the opportunity to slash and destroy it. Übel picks up Land's escape golem bottle as the replica disappears and comments that the bottle was fake too. Übel watches Land's wounded clone disappear, and Land asks why she took such a risk when his clone was dying. Übel replies that she knew he would save her, which prompts him to ask if he seemed that kind to her. Übel responds that he does not, however, he refused to accept her escape golem, and he appeared to be someone that did not want others to die because of him. Thus, she created a situation where she would die because of him. Übel then playfully thanks Land and adds that she learned something new about him. Land asks if she can sympathize with him better now, but she replies that it would take more time for that to happen.

In another part of the dungeon, Frieren's group continues venturing through. Frieren is suddenly distracted by a wall and asks Fern to see the map. Fern reminds her that they have already explored the floor, but Frieren has a feeling that there is a hidden room behind the wall and speculates about the discovery of a rare grimoire. Fern looks at the map with Sense and comments that there are no entrances, however, Frieren investigates the wall further and activates a mechanism. The monumental statues on the wall begin to move and shift away, which reveals a hidden stair passage.

The three of them scale the steps to enter a large chamber with a mural, which fascinates Fern. Sense describes the mural as one that depicts the achievements of the king of the Unified Dynasty era, who was buried in the tomb. She adds that she has never seen such a well-preserved mural from that time. As they leave the chamber, Fern notes that their progress has been unusually smooth and wonders if they will pass without any issues.

Frieren's group proceeds through the dungeon and eventually arrives at a chamber, where they find Denken's group. Frieren asks why they are all here, and Denken states that according to his knowledge of the dungeon's layout, beyond the hall should be the depths of the labyrinth. He alludes to the threat behind the doors to the hall, and Frieren looks through the doors to see her clone. Frieren lights up and excitedly says that this is how conquering a dungeon should be. She notes that the clone is a perfect replica and appraises it to be equal in strength to her. Denken tells her that they cannot conquer the dungeon without eliminating the clone and asks her for ideas. Frieren remarks that, assuming the clone is a perfect replica, its weaknesses should match hers.

Richter brings up that restraint or hypnosis magic could be used to defeat a stronger mage, but Frieren tells him that she is resistant to both. Denken comments that it might offer them a small opening, which should be enough. He remembers that Methode is capable of such magic, but she tells him that it is not her forte. However, she decides to test the magic on Frieren and attempts to restrain her by wrapping her arms around the elf, but she notes that it is ineffective. She wonders about the result, as restraint magic should typically work if there is not a major difference in mana. Methode proceeds to test her hypnosis magic on Frieren, but it fails due to Frieren's mental defenses.

Fern is displeased by Methode being so close to Frieren and drags her master away from her. After Denken summarizes that Frieren is resistant to both types of magic, Methode reveals that Frieren's mental defense is complex and strong, but it seems to be an older technique, and an expert in hypnosis magic might be able to find a vulnerability. Denken asks if any of the examinees match that criteria, and Methode brings up second-class mage Edel. However, she shares that Edel has almost no combat ability and wonders if she could make it this far. Methode also adds that hypnosis only works if the target has a mind, and it is unclear if the clones have replicated that, which makes Denken lament their lack of information.

In another area of the dungeon, Edel, Dünste, and Blei, hide behind a pillar in a large room in the dungeon. Blei asks Edel what she thinks while he glances at a clone of Sense, who is moving across the room in a lower corridor. Edel states that she does not know but claims that it is safe to assume it has all of the abilities of the first-class mage Sense. Blei tells them that they have no choice but to fight it, as they can only conceal their mana for so long. Edel questions their ability to do so and adds that the three of them cannot fight properly in the dungeon. Dünste notes that modern magic is not particularly helpful to fight in such a setting, and Edel points out that this is a side effect of most dungeons having been conquered during the era leading up to the Demon King's defeat. She also adds that creating powerful defensive spells has taken too many resources, so offensive spells now mostly rely on controlling natural elements as manipulating and transforming one's surroundings is more efficient than creating something. She explains that Sense's clone does this very well, as its hair is infused with multiple layers of magic, which would give it many ways to fight in the dungeon. Additionally, since magic is all about visualization, the clone's ability to manipulate countless strands of hair would mean that it has a superhuman imagination, making it the strongest mage in the room. Edel reflects that them evading the clone until now is a miracle, and they have done their best and should give up now since they are not fighters.

Blei asks Edel if her voice can reach Sense's clone, and Edel responds that although hypnosis magic is her family's calling, it is impossible to get the clone to meet the conditions of any high-level orders. She claims that at best she can make it kneel, and even then, she has to make eye contact and call out to it. Blei says that it is not an impossible task then, but Edel reminds him that it is only possible if the clone has a mind. Dünste asks how long they need to hold it off; Edel tells him fifteen seconds as that is all they can manage. At that moment, Sense's clone picks up on the group's presence and suddenly cuts their surroundings and the pillar they are hiding behind with its hair magic. The pillar collapses, revealing them, and as they float to the ground, Edel uses a telekinesis spell on the debris and launches it to attack the replica. The attack has no effect on the clone, as it easily cuts through the stone with its hair. Edel commands Blei and Dünste to prepare defensive magic in a sphere, and the two mages comply. She reveals that in modern magic, there are two ways to break defensive magic: either break through it with mass or slip past it with techniques. As Sense's clone manipulates its hair to take the shape of drills and press against the defensive sphere, Edel is surprised that it is overcoming the defense using both methods at the same time. The clone breaks the barrier, pushing them back.

Edel says to her comrades that she thought the defense would last the full fifteen seconds, but it managed to break it even sooner. However, she makes eye contact and notes that superior mages tend to keep their enemies in sight. Edel then commands the clone to kneel, but the clone immediately pierces through Edel with its hair. With this attack, Edel realizes that the clone does not have a mind and is just accurately imitating one, and thus, they are no match for it. Dünste casts an offensive spell but misses, and Edel tells them that they have no choice but to rely on others and says that they should use all their might to flee and find someone who can fight it. Edel adds that she does not want to get hurt anymore, so she is going home. She breaks her escape golem's bottle, which protects her against another attack by Sense's clone and escapes with her.

While the escape golem carries Edel out of harm's way, Blei tells Dünste that they should also run away. As they flee, Dünste asks if there is anyone who can safely reach the bottom. Blei brings up that Sense never intended for an examinee to pass the test from the beginning.

In the meantime, other groups continue their way through the dungeon. Übel and Land cross a small channel of water, Kanne and Lawine check their map and run through a passage, and Ton cowers in a tunnel, seemingly haven given up. Back in the chamber leading to the depths of the dungeon, Frieren tells the group that they lack information and they should assume the clone does not have a mind, which means they might have to take it down with brute force. Denken asks Frieren if she can do it, and she replies that she feels uncertain. 

At the same time in the dungeon, Wirbel's team continues combat against their counterparts as they hide behind the barrier that Scharf created out of metal petals. Scharf's clone protects Wirbel's clone with a similar barrier, and Ehre's clone attacks from above. Wirbel notes that it is unclear what the clones are thinking but considers that their matchup is not that bad. As he fires at Ehre's clone, he reasons that in a simple clash of mana, Ehre could easily take out Scharf or himself. However, he is sure he knows how to win and charges up a strong offensive spell that breaks the ceiling above Ehre's replica and sends debris falling down on it.

Back at the chamber leading to the hall, Denken dejectedly restates Frieren's words. Fern raises her hand and tells them that if they need to use brute force, she might be able to kill Frieren's clone. Frieren smiles at her apprentice and says that they should now come up with a strategy.

## Episode Notes]

- The anime has Genau talking with Falsch about the Spiegel and Sense's exam before Denken's group escapes from Frieren's clone. This sequence happens the other way around in the manga.
During Genau's description of the Spiegel to Falsch, the anime depicts the Einsam by reusing the confrontation between Fern and the Einsam conjuring Heiter's ghost from Episode 5, whereas in the manga, only the Einsam on its own is depicted.

- After Denken's group escapes from Frieren's clone, the scenes of Richter and Denken's remarks while the latter observes Frieren's clone from outside of the hall are anime original.

- In the anime, the dead end Übel mentions is created due to rubble, whereas in the manga, it is a wall.

- When Land brings up that the clone may be cautious of Sorganeil, he recalls how Übel bound him with the spell in an alley, which is a unique addition in the anime.

- The sequence of events depicting Frieren discovering the hidden room and her group exploring it is original to the anime.
The hidden chamber with the mural of the King of the Unified Dynasty were designed by the anime's concept artist, Seiko Yoshioka, who coordinated with the authors of the manga, Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe, to incorporate important elements to fill in the backgrounds of the anime. Seiko Yoshioka states in an interview that it was enjoyable to work on the tomb as a representation of the Unified Dynasty era.

- The anime slightly rearranges the dialogue of Edel, Blei, and Dünste before the fight with Sense's clone begins. Additionally, the fight with Sense's clone is extended upon in the anime.
In the anime, Sense's clone slices through the pillars and the surroundings of Edel's group, which forces them to descend from a raised corridor to the lower corridor where the clone is located. In the manga, Sense's clone only slices through the pillars in the corridor, and Edel's team fights Sense's clone after it ascends to the raised corridor.

- The telekinesis spell that Edel uses to hurl debris at Sense's clone is not depicted in the manga.

- The anime shows the clone's hair forming thick drills to emphasize Edel's comment about the two methods to overcome defensive magic.

- The dialogue between Blei and Dünste while running away from Sense's clone is original to the anime.

- The montage that depicts Übel and Land, Kanne and Lawine, Ton, and the entrance of the tomb before cutting to Frieren's group discussing a strategy is original to the anime.

- The fight of Wirbel, Scharf and Ehre against their clones in before the strategy meeting among Frieren's group is not included in the manga. The next time the group is depicted in the manga is in Chapter 55, when they have already defeated their clones.

## [ARCS] Episode 25
**A Fatal Vulnerability** ｢致 (ち) 命 (めい) 的 (てき) な隙 (すき) , *Chimeiteki na suki*?｣ is the twenty-fifth episode of the *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* anime series, released on March 1, 2024. It is the ninth episode of the second cour of *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* Season 1.

## Synopsis]

A perfect imitation of Frieren stands between the test-takers and victory, but Fern believes she knows how to win. Is it time for the student to surpass the master?

## Plot]

In the Ruins of the King's Tomb, Fern suggests that she can kill Frieren's clone, and Frieren smiles and recalls Serie saying something in the past. She then prompts them to come up with a strategy. A while later, Frieren summarizes that if the clone has a mind, they will use Edel's hynopsis magic to penetrate her clone's mental defenses and give Fern an opening to kill it. Right as she finishes, a wounded Dünste arrives. Methode rushes to him and asks about Edel and Blei's whereabouts. Dünste reveals that Edel dropped out of the exam after they were attacked by Sense's clone, and Blei stayed behind to fight the clone, giving Dünste the opportunity to escape. He requests for them to cooperate with him, as he has information. Denken tells him that cooperating was his intention in the first place and asks the group if there is anyone that can heal Dünste. Methode has a Holy Scripture that enables her to cast simple recovery magic, which she uses to heal Dünste.

After Methode heals him, Dünste reveals that the clones are mindless and adds that according to Edel, they simply imitate the workings of the original mind, but they lack a mind of their own. Frieren determines that with this reveal, they no longer have the easy option to defeat the clone, so they have to formulate a strategy with that in mind. Denken tells Frieren that there are still too many unknown factors, including the true identity of the clones and their summoner, and they cannot take action until they understand the nature of the clones. Richter adds that they need to figure out whether the clones have any unique weaknesses, and a clone as strong as Frieren will likely lead to casualties. Richter looks at Sense, but as the proctor, she refuses to provide any information.

Suddenly, Lawine and Kanne arrive at the entrance of the chamber. Lawine tells them that the clones do not have any weaknesses and that the identity of the controller of the clones is a monster referred to as the Spiegel, which has been around since the mythical era. Denken asks her how she knows this, and Lawine replies that her oldest brother was a member of the advance party the Continental Magic Association sent to raid the Ruins of the King's Tomb. 

Richter remarks that it makes sense she and Kanne managed to get this far with the information they had. He also adds that she should have shared her information and cooperated with them from the start. She tells him that it did not seem like they could work together, and Kanne adds that Frieren and Fern were gone by the time they realized that working together would be ideal. Lawine also tells Richter that a middle-aged man like him would not hesitate to abandon his allies, adding to their unwillingness to cooperate. Richter concedes that he is indeed middle-aged, but he laments that her statement still hurts when said to his face. Kanne tells Lawine that she should apologize, which she does, but she addresses him once more as a middle-aged man.

Drawing upon the observations of the advance party, Lawine reveals that the Spiegel itself is a harmless and frail monster that is lying in the treasury room behind the door that Frieren's clone is guarding, which Denken's mana detection confirms. Denken and Frieren reveal another problem in the form of a sealing spell, which was placed by the clone on the door to the treasury room. Frieren explains that the spell is a top-class sealing spell and only the clone's defeat will remove the spell. She then deduces that the walls around the door are also similarly protected, which leaves them the sole option of fighting Frieren's clone to defeat the Spiegel.

Lawine urges the group to act swiftly, as the Spiegel's clones habitually gather at their current location, which is where the previous advance party, save for her brother's unit, met their demise. Fern confirms with Dünste that the clones imitate the exact actions of their hosts and that their behavioral weaknesses would remain the same. With this knowledge, Fern reveals that the group may have a chance. Frieren asks what vulnerability she has in mind, and Fern asks her master to stand next to a wall. Fern proceeds to quickly fire an offensive spell, which Frieren defends against with defense magic. 

Kanne and Lawine are unable to notice anything, but Denken and Methode are astonished to find a fatal vulnerability in that Frieren's mana detection is interrupted for a fraction of a second the instant a spell is cast. Laufen says that this is a common error for apprentice mages, and Frieren admits that it has been a weak point of hers and she did not mention it as it was embarrassing, much to Fern's annoyance. Richter believes that almost no mage in existence would be able to exploit this vulnerability due to Frieren's extraordinary abilities, but the group decides to continue their strategy meeting nevertheless. As Frieren contributes to the meeting, Fern points out that she seems to be particularly enjoying the discussion.

After hearing Fern's comment, Frieren thinks back to the Hero Party's journey where the party ventured into a dungeon and strategized while hiding behind a pillar in the presence of a large monster. The party reached a verdict as Himmel instructed Eisen to grab the monster's attention while he would flank it, with Frieren providing support. Frieren asked about Heiter's role and Himmel revealed that the priest was currently hungover. The party moved to attack the monster, with Eisen luring the monster to follow him and Frieren attacking it from the side, which caused it to tumble. Himmel then proceeded to strike the monster, thrusting his sword into the monster's back and killing it.

In the present, Frieren tells Fern that she is reminiscing about the Hero Party and how they would hold meetings similar to the current strategy meeting between the mages. The group continues to discuss their strategy and ultimately concludes the meeting. Before Frieren and Fern enter the hall to face the clone, Denken asks them if they can win. Frieren tells him that there does not exist a dungeon that cannot be conquered, and she backs up her claim by stating that she is the mage of the party that conquered the most dungeons in history. Denken follows up by asking if the duo will be alright fighting Frieren's replica on their own, and Frieren reassures him they will be fine, explaining that it is easier to predict the clone's movements with fewer people. She also points out that while victory would be guaranteed if the group of mages fought together, most would perish in the battle with no time to use the escape golems. Richter confirms that the rest of the mages should hinder the progress of the additional clones spawning in the dungeon, and Frieren agrees, as being cornered on both ends would lead to everyone's demise.

Kanne and Lawine then open the doors for Frieren and Fern to enter the hall, where Frieren's clone is waiting. As the hall's doors close, Denken and the rest of the mages begin to discuss which members of the group pose the biggest threat to themselves in order to give everyone the most advantageous matchups. 

Meanwhile, inside the hall, Frieren and her clone mirror each other using flying magic and point their staffs at each other. They both attempt to use offensive magic, but they predict each others' attacks and guard with defensive magic. Frieren proceeds to cast Judradjim, a destructive lightning spell. At the same time, Fern takes cover behind a pillar and escapes just as the lightning strikes fill the hall, and she observes that the clone is behaving exactly as Frieren predicted. With much destruction caused by the exchange, both Frieren and her clone come to a standoff while pointing their staffs at each other.

A column begins to collapse over them, and they simultaneously cast Vollzanbel, which summons a pillar of fire that melts through the column and encompasses the area. Frieren thinks to herself that she stopped detecting mana and that the clone would be wary of Fern, who had used the opportunity to hide. Frieren deduces that the clone will now be on the lookout for Fern but will struggle to do so, as it is occupied with an equally matched opponent. As the clone closes in on Frieren, Frieren reflects that she knows all too well how frightening she can be.

Prior to the battle, Frieren reassured Fern that she will be alright, as even she struggles to detect her apprentice once she conceals herself completely. Fern asked if Zoltraak would be enough to kill the clone, and Frieren responded that it will, given it is the quickest spell to cast. Frieren explained that Zoltraak was a relatively new spell among elves, so she lacked the ingrained reflexes to defend against it. Therefore, the slightest of movements would have to be spared for her to initiate a counter. Frieren recalled Fern's training during her youth and told her that Zoltraak has existed since her birth. As a fundamental mage spell, it was engraved into her from the very beginning, which is precisely why Fern's Zoltraak posed a mortal danger to Frieren. In the present, Fern runs out from behind the pillar and prepares to ambush the clone.

Approximately a millenium ago, Frieren approached Serie in her throne hall. Serie believed that she would never meet Frieren again due to Frieren's apparent disdain for her. Frieren unveiled her true purpose for the visit: delivering the will of the deceased Flamme. Serie noted that it had been fifty years since Serie had last met with Flamme. Frieren asked Serie if the news saddened her, and Serie, without displaying any particular emotional reaction, simply claimed that Flamme had been a pupil she had raised on a whim. Serie proceeded to read the will and noted that it resembled more of a report than a will. When Frieren inquired about the contents, Serie shared that The Emperor gave official approval for widespread research and exploration of magic within human societies, which once viewed all forms of magic as demonic. Flamme had played a pivotal role in influencing the Emperor's decision, even taking on the task of educating the newly established Imperial Mages.

Serie described the primary purpose of the will, which was to implore Serie to assume the responsibilities left behind by Flamme. Serie expressed disdain at Flamme's greediness, as approving the research of magic had already been a major achievement. When Frieren asked Serie about the significance of this, Serie explained that it meant that the largest empire on the continent had now begun to research magic and used it for military affairs, which would encourage surrounding countries to follow suit, and in just a few decades, magic would spread all over the continent. This signified an era in which mankind would be able to use magic and, in the foreseeable future, oppose the Demon King and his army. Frieren smiled as she commented that Flamme's achievements are truly incredible.

Serie raised Flamme's will and cut it into pieces, revealing that this was not what she wanted. She told Frieren to leave and declared that she was displeased and would not comply with the request, as magic was meant to be special, and she did not intend to teach anyone without talent. With disappointment, Serie claimed that she and Flamme could never truly understand each other in the end. Frieren then mentioned that Flamme had already predicted Serie's exact reactions, however, Flamme still wanted to tell Serie that her dream had come true regardless.

Frieren prepared to take her leave, but Serie invited her on a walk, claiming that they had all the time in the world. As the two strolled through a forest, Serie revealed that Flamme's dream was an era in which anyone could use magic and things like serving mankind and opposing the Demon King did not initially matter to Flamme. Serie recalled Flamme as a young girl, and she disclosed that Flamme's favorite spell was a spell to produce a field of flowers, which Serie found foolish. Flamme's deep love for magic was so profound that she wished for the entire world to embrace such magic, a dream that Serie initially dismissed as something befitting only for young girls. She believed that such an era would unfold only long after Flamme's own lifetime, given the transient nature of human existence compared to an elf's enduring life. Nevertheless, Flamme ultimately became the founder of humanity's magic. Frieren opened up about Flamme's characteristic hastiness in making decisions as if she was always in a hurry. Serie explained that the lifespans of humans meant that they existed in a place far closer to death than elves like them, and humans cannot afford to postpone crucial decisions. She added that this stood in stark contrast to elves, who can choose to defer the same decisions for a century or even a millennium.

As the two elves exited the forest, they approached a cliff that overlooked a valley. Serie told Frieren that many years have passed and since then, humanity established what could be called a civilization. Serie explained that such progress would begin to accelerate and in only a mere one thousand years, the era of humans would arrive. In Serie's mind, humans would one day overtake the elves, and she advised Frieren to not neglect her training. Serie emphasized her point by saying that if Frieren were to lose her life, it would either be at the hands of the Demon King or a human mage. With a smile, Frieren responded that she is looking forward to that era, as she will have the opportunity to encounter various new mages and spells.

In the present battle, Frieren makes way for Fern so she can successfully envelop the clone in a concentrated Zoltraak blast. Frieren appears satisfied at Fern's ambush, but in contrast, Fern appears stoic.

## [FACTIONS] Continental Magic Association
The **Continental Magic Association** ｢大 (たい) 陸 (りく) 魔 (ま) 法 (ほう) 協 (きょう) 会 (かい) , *Tairiku Mahō Kyōkai*?｣ is an organization established by Serie that acts as the ruling body for mages across the continent. 

## Overview]

The Continental Magic Association was established by the Great Mage Serie over fifty years prior to the present day, and it oversees the regulation and hierarchy of mages as well as their deployment on various missions. The association is also responsible for administering the mage class exams and doling out class certifications for mages based on the results of these exams.

Mages can be certified from ninth to first-class, with any mages below fifth-class being considered apprentice mages. Some first-class mages receive the opportunity to become Serie's apprentices, and besides being sent out on missions, they may also be asked to proctor mage exams. The Continental Magic Association may be affiliated with the education of mages through establishments such as the Academy of Magic. 

## Branches]

There are at least two branches of the Continental Magic Association.

### Strahl Headquarters]

The headquarters of the association is located in the Holy City of Strahl, and it is also one of the two locations for the First-Class Mage Exam.

### Continental Magic Association Northern Branch]

The **Northern Branch** ｢北 (ほく) 部 (ぶ) 支 (し) 部 (ぶ) , *Hokubu Shibu*?｣ of the Continental Magic Association is located in the Magical Town of Äußerst, the largest city of magic in the Northern Lands.. Serie regularly spends time here, and many first and second-class mages that take missions in the Northern Plateau are based out of the northern branch. The First-Class Mage Exam is detailed to the examinees within the assembly hall of this branch. Serie's room at this branch consists of a great hall, where she receives the first-class mages and other guests.

## Serie's Throne Room]

Though not confirmed to be part of the Continental Magic Association, Serie's dwelling a thousand years prior to the establishment of the association consisted of a throne at the end of a hall. She was visited at this location by Frieren twice: once as an apprentice, where she was accompanied by Flamme, and a second time after Flamme's death, where she brought Flamme's will to Serie.

## [FACTIONS] Magic Special Forces
The **Magic Special Forces** ｢魔 (ま) 導 (どう) 特 (とく) 務 (む) 隊 (たい) , *Madō tokumutai*?｣ is the Empire's military unit of mages serving as operators that focus on handling uprisings, particularly among mages.

## Overview]

The Magic Special Forces is an organization consisting of the most powerful mages within the Empire. Imperial mages are trained in warfare and utilize magic specialized for military purposes, with members of the forces being mages officially acknowledged by the Empire. As a result, the forces act as national defense operators/agents that focus on handling uprisings or other incidents involving mages within the Empire. The unit is also tasked with defense missions, such as acting as bodyguards, monitoring gates, and guarding the Empire's borders. First-class mages have a disadvantage against members of the Magic Special Forces, as although the former might consist of the best mages across the continent, the latter's members specialize in warfare with magic.

## [FACTIONS] Seven Sages of Destruction
The **Seven Sages of Destruction** ｢七 (しち) 崩 (ほう) 賢 (けん) , *Shichihōken*?｣ were a group of seven powerful demon mages who served the Demon King until his demise. They also followed orders from the Demon King's Confidant, Schlacht the Omniscient. In the past, the Sages were important generals of the Demon King's army, securing key areas of interest in the Northern Lands. At the time, they were regarded as the greatest threat to humanity. As of the present day, all known members are believed to be deceased, and the group is defunct.

## History]

### Hero of the South]

In the midst of the war against the Demon King, all seven of the Sages were recruited by Schlacht the Omniscient to confront the Hero of the South. During this battle, Schlacht and three of the Seven Sages of Destruction were taken down by the Hero of the South.

### Hero Party]

Early in their journey, the Hero Party confronted Aura the Guillotine. They destroyed most of her undead army and forced her to retreat, but were unable to kill her. Less than seven years into their journey, they killed Böse the Immortal. Sometime between seven and ten years into their journey, they killed Grausam the Miraculous.

After the Demon King was defeated by the Hero Party, the remaining Sages, Aura and Macht of the Golden Land, escaped or went missing. Macht was later sealed in the Great Barrier of the Golden Land by Serie's apprentices. After the death of Himmel the Hero, Aura resurfaced in the Northern Lands and began to wage war against Graf Granat's Domain.

## Synopsis]

### Aura the Guillotine Arc]

Twenty-eight years after Himmel's passing, Aura the Guillotine was defeated by Frieren.

### The Golden Land Arc]

The last remaining Sage, Macht of the Golden Land, was defeated by Denken thirty years after Himmel's passing.

## Known Members]

### Aura the Guillotine]

*Main article: Aura*
Aura ascended to her seat among the Seven Sages of Destruction 500 years ago. She uses the spell Auserlese with her Scales of Obedience, which weighs the amount of mana of two souls and grants the party with more mana dominion over the other's body. The control of her magic is near absolute with the exceptions of extremely resilient souls. Because of this, Aura decapitates every body she controls, granting her the moniker of "Aura the Guillotine".

Aura managed to survive a battle against the Hero Party. This battle depleted her of most of her undead army, and she was forced to go into hiding after the Demon King was defeated. However, when the Hero Himmel died, she resurfaced once again and began to wage war against Graf Granat's Domain. Aura was later defeated by Frieren through deception as the latter tipped the Scales of Obedience with her larger mana pool.

### Böse the Immortal]

*Main article: Böse*
The Hero Party faced off against Böse on their journey to defeat the Demon King. During their battle, Böse trapped the party in his barrier, which Frieren considered indestructible and nearly accepted defeat. However, she managed to dispel the barrier within at least two months after encouragement from her companions. Frieren's ability to break through his barrier led to Böse focusing on her while fighting and underestimating the rest of the party, resulting in his death at the hands of Himmel. His subjugation became one of the adventure tales told about the Hero Party.

### Macht of the Golden Land]

*Main article: Macht*
Macht is considered to be the most powerful Sage of Destruction. He uses his spell to transmute all creation into gold, Diagoldze, a powerful curse which cannot be detected, analyzed or dispelled. The gold he creates with his magic is unmalleable and distinct from naturally occurring gold. In addition, he is a powerful physical fighter, who often preferred to fight with a sword. Macht uses the coat he wears on his left shoulder in battle, either transforming it into a large golden sword, or turning it into gold as a shield. He is also proficient at using other types of humanity's magic. Macht is one of the eleven mages that defeated Frieren in battle before, despite having less mana than her. He fought her six hundred years prior and turned her right arm to gold, which took a century for Frieren to restore.

Unlike most of his fellow demons, Macht dislikes conflict, battles and expresses a desire to understand humanity's emotions, despite his repeated failure to attain the latter. His efforts to understand and attain human emotion led him to raze several villages and eventually led to his meeting with Solitär. At some point, Schlacht and Grausam showed up to recruit Macht for their battle against the Hero of the South. Macht would survive this battle, but his memories of it were wiped by Grausam.

After the defeat of the Demon King and later Aura, he was the last surviving Sage of Destruction. Macht made a deal with Glück to allow the latter to live and attempt to teach him human emotions such as guilt and malice He also took in Denken as his student during this time. He eventually turned the Fortified City of Weise to gold in an attempt to experience human emotions. Macht intended on escaping into the Empire but was confronted by Serie and her first-class mage apprentices, which included Lernen. Serie allowed her apprentices to seal Macht, along with the Fortified City of Weise, into the Great Barrier of the Golden Land.

For the next half a century he would spend his time in the golden city. He was finally defeated by Denken the moment he was distracted by the sight of Fortified City of Weise slowly returning to normal with Frieren's newly-developed protective spell that nullifies his Diagoldze. This gave Denken enough time to pierce through his heart. Despite on the verge of death, Macht still managed to walk his way towards Glück's last location where the latter lits him a cigarette. Denken eventually finishes him off after reaching him. 

### Grausam the Miraculous]

*Main article: Grausam*
Grausam appeared alongside the other Sages of Destruction in order to fight the Hero of the South. He made an appearance when Frieren was reading Macht's memories, where his appearance was used to threaten Macht to comply with Schlacht's demand. Macht himself states that Grausam's magic is the worst match up for Macht. He has demonstrated the ability to erase memories.

Grausam's magic is the Spell to guide to paradise: Ansehelschella, which puts the opponent to sleep and makes them experience an endless illusion of a happy dream, even if impossible. He casts Ansehelschella upon the Hero Party with the intention of seizing Frieren's memories of the future. Grausam's magic is especially effective to those that rely on mana detection. However, priests that are as strong and devout as Heiter are immune from his magic, implying that like Macht, Grausam's magic is considered a curse.

Besides his mental magic, Grausam does not demonstrate proficiency in any offense magic. He is shown to fight using the swords generated by Solitär's spell. Upon getting injured by Himmel, he exhibits extreme fear and killing intent, which Solitär scolds him for. Despite the fact that the Hero Party was able to break his spell, Grausam was able to learn something from Frieren's memories of the future.

The **Shadow Warriors** ｢影 (かげ) なる戦 (せん) 士 (し) , *Kagenaru Senshi*?｣ is a secret order of warriors formed specifically to counteract mages. They were not publicly acknowledged and by order disbanded by the previous emperor.

## Overview]

The Shadow Warriors is an organization composed of warriors who specialize in concealing their mana. They were originally established during the era of the Unified Empire in response to the growing number and prevalence of mages. It is one of the Empire's covert units, alongside the Court of the Sacred Staff and the publicly acknowledged Magic Special Forces, with its primary functions being to counter mages and prevent rebellions.

The unit is a clandestine organization, undertaking top-secret missions known only to a select few. Shadow Warriors swear loyalty to the Empire, with their primary task being assassination, as operatives carry out targeted killings from predetermined lists. They follow orders without question and are expected to lay down their lives for the cause. Additionally, they are told that they do not need to understand the motives behind their assignments. Desertion is treated as treason and punished by execution.

By order of the previous emperor the Shadow Warriors were disbanded sixteen years prior to the events of Serie's visit to the Foundation Festival.

### Structure]

Many Shadow Warriors are taken young from orphanages and trained from childhood how to fight. They weren't organized like a conventional military unit. Seemingly commanders on the ground were granted considerable authority. The use of force within the Empire was allowed and they could choose their own targets for assassinations - "The List." A group of Shadow Warriors is led by a cell commander. In the past, there were multiple commanding officers. However, in the present, the only known leader is Commander Löwe, to whom various Shadow Warriors answer.

### Uniform]

Members of the Shadow Warriors once wore sleek, form-fitting dark outfits. In the present, they do not appear to have a standard uniform, opting instead for attire suited to their specific missions and environments.

## Synopsis]

### History]

Approximately twenty-one years after the defeat of the Demon King, the Empire fell into turmoil due to a succession crisis following the death of the late Emperor. Amidst the chaos, a Shadow Warrior officer dispatched a team of four operatives, including Radaal, to guard a mountain path in the Aufgabe Federation. They were explicitely ordered to eliminate all targets on a designated list, including Frieren and many others who had once contributed to the Empire.

Over time, various commanding officers of the Shadow Warriors lost their positions, resulting in many covert operations vanishing into thin air. Without formal orders to conclude their missions, some operatives, like Radaal, continued to carry them out for decades.

### Imperial Territory Travels Arc]

As Frieren and her party pass through a village in the Aufgabe Federation and rest in a vacant house, Radaal recognizes her as the last person on his list from decades ago. That night, he attempts to kill her but ultimately fails. Frieren convinces him to give up on his mission, pointing out that no one remembers it anymore.

### Foundation Festival Arc]

In the midst of the National Foundation Festival, Löwe assembles a group of Shadow Warriors for the mission to assassinate the Great Mage Serie. The team consists of Schritt, Wolf, Iris, Routine, Clematis, Lore, Wehrlos, and Gazelle. He assigns them the task of dealing with Serie's bodyguards, including Sense and Frieren, while he goes after Serie herself.
