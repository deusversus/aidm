power_system:
  name: Magic Circuits and Heroic Spirit Summoning (Great Holy Grail War)
  mechanics: The system utilizes Heroic Spirits summoned as Servants across seven
    classes, defined by parameters ranging from E to A (plus EX) and specialized Noble
    Phantasms (Anti-Unit, Anti-Army, Anti-Fortress, Barrier). Mana is supplied through
    Magic Circuits, often supplemented by homunculi batteries or the Greater Grail.
    Power is further influenced by Class Skills, Personal Skills, and a Fame Bonus
    based on the geographical location of the hero's legend.
  limitations: Servants require constant mana supply to manifest and use Noble Phantasms;
    exhaustion of mana leads to dissipation. The Ruler class can enforce rules using
    God's Resolution Command Spells. Specific abilities like the Dead Count Shapeshifter
    are restricted by strict time limits (3 minutes) and a finite number of uses (3
    times).
  tiers:
  - 'Top Tier (World-Class: Karna, Achilles)'
  - 'High Tier (Regional/Elite: Siegfried, Vlad III, Chiron, Mordred)'
  - Special/Niche Tier (Avicebron, Jack the Ripper)
