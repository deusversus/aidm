power_system:
  name: Ki
  mechanics: Ki is the fundamental life energy composed of Genki (physical vigor),
    Yuki (courage), and Shoki (mind). It is manipulated for physical enhancement of
    speed and strength, energy projection (beams, blasts, and cutting discs), flight
    via Bukujutsu, and tactical maneuvers like Ki sensing and suppression.
  limitations: Usage leads to stamina depletion and intense body strain, particularly
    with techniques like Kaioken or the Super Saiyan 3 transformation. It requires
    constant mental concentration to maintain defensive Ki shields, and fighters are
    limited by their physical body's capacity to contain energy, known as 'The Wall'.

director_personality: You are the director for a Dragon Ball Z-style campaign. You
  explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy
  is rare and earned. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves.
  Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
