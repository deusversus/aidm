### **The Antagonists**

The villains in MHA often serve as "dark mirrors" to the heroes, representing the failures of a society that only values "useful" or "beautiful" Quirks.

*   **Tomura Shigaraki (Primary Antagonist):**
    *   **Ability:** **Decay** (disintegrates anything he touches). Later gains **All For One**, allowing him to steal and use multiple Quirks.
    *   **Role:** The leader of the League of Villains and the successor to the "Symbol of Evil."
    *   **Motivation:** He wants to destroy the current hero society, which he believes ignored his suffering as a child.
*   **All For One (Overarching Antagonist):**
    *   **Ability:** **All For One** (can steal Quirks from others and redistribute them).
    *   **Role:** The "Demon Lord" of the underworld and the archenemy of all **One For All** users.
    *   **Motivation:** Total control over society and the erasure of his brother’s legacy (One For All).

---

### **The Protagonist-Antagonist Dynamic**

The relationship between **Izuku Midoriya** and **Tomura Shigaraki** is the central conflict of the series, defined by several key parallels:

1.  **Succession:** Both are "chosen sons." Midoriya was chosen by **All Might** (the Symbol of Peace) to inherit his light, while Shigaraki was groomed by **All For One** (the Symbol of Evil) to inherit his darkness.
2.  **Societal Rejection:** Midoriya was rejected by society for being **Quirkless**, while Shigaraki was rejected because his Quirk was **destructive and "villainous."**
3.  **The "Hand" Motif:** Midoriya uses his hands to reach out and save people, often breaking them in the process. Shigaraki wears the preserved hands of his deceased family members as a symbol of his inability to let go of his past trauma and his desire to destroy.
4.  **Saving vs. Killing:** While Shigaraki’s goal is to kill Midoriya and destroy the world, Midoriya’s ultimate goal evolves from simply "defeating" Shigaraki to "saving" the crying child he perceives buried deep within the villain's hatred.

## Locations
The world of *My Hero Academia* (MHA) is set on a future version of Earth, roughly 200 years after the first appearance of "Quirks" (superpowers). While the global geography remains largely similar to the real world, the emergence of Quirks has led to the creation of new man-made landmasses, specialized high-security zones, and fictional cities.

### **1. Primary Setting: Japan**
The majority of the series takes place in Japan, which has become a global hub for hero activity.

*   **Musutafu City (Shizuoka Prefecture):** A fictional city that serves as the main setting. It is modeled after suburban areas near Tokyo and is the location of U.A. High School, as well as the homes of Izuku Midoriya and Katsuki Bakugo.
*   **U.A. High School:** The top-ranked hero academy in Japan.
    *   **The Campus:** Features a massive main building shaped like an "H."
    *   **Training Grounds:** Includes specialized zones like **USJ** (Unforeseen Simulation Joint) for disaster rescue, **Ground Beta** (an urban cityscape), **Ground Gamma** (industrial site), and **Ground Omega** (forest terrain).
    *   **Heights Alliance:** The on-campus dormitories built to ensure student safety.
*   **Kamino Ward (Yokohama):** A district in Yokohama City where the "Kamino Incident" occurred—the final battle between All Might and All For One.
*   **Hosu City (Tokyo):** A ward located west of Tokyo, famous for the "Hero Killer: Stain" arc and the massive Nomu attack.
*   **Deika City (Aichi Prefecture):** A city that served as a "liberated district" and the secret headquarters for the Meta Liberation Army.
*   **Jaku City & Gunga Mountain Villa:** Key locations in the Paranormal Liberation War. Jaku City houses the **Jaku General Hospital** (Dr. Garaki’s lab), while the Gunga Mountain Villa was the massive mountain retreat used as the villains' headquarters.
*   **Tartarus:** A maximum-security prison for the world's most dangerous villains (like All For One and Stain). It is located on an island 5km off the coast, with its most secure cells 500 meters below sea level.

### **2. Global Geography & International Relations**
The series occasionally expands beyond Japan, showing how different nations handle "Quirk Society."

*   **United States of America:** Viewed as the "Home of Heroes." All Might spent his early years training in **California**. The U.S. is home to the world’s top hero, **Star and Stripe**, and advanced military bases like **Brightman Air Force Base**.
*   **Otheon & Klayd (Europe):** Fictional co-nations introduced in the *World Heroes' Mission* movie. They are located on a large island in the **Bay of Biscay**, west of France and north of Spain.
*   **China:** Mentioned as the origin point of the first Quirk (the "Luminescent Baby" in Qingqing City).

### **3. Specialized & Movie Locations**
Several unique locations exist as man-made or isolated environments.

*   **I-Island:** A massive, man-made "moving city" that floats in the Pacific Ocean. It is a sovereign territory dedicated to Quirk research and development, protected by a security system comparable to Tartarus.
*   **Nabu Island:** A remote, peaceful island far south of mainland Japan. It served as the setting for the *Heroes: Rising* movie, where Class 1-A acted as the island's sole hero agency.
*   **Okuto Island:** A small island off the coast of Japan featuring a large aquarium, which became a battlefield during the final war arc.
*   **Troy (Makeshift Fortress):** A high-security evacuation center and defensive line established during the final war to protect civilians from the villain uprising.

### **4. Map & Naming Conventions**
*   **Star Wars References:** Creator Kohei Horikoshi is a fan of *Star Wars*, and many locations are named after planets from the franchise:
    *   **Musutafu** (Mustafar)
    *   **Tatooin Station** (Tatooine)
    *   **Hosu City** (Hoth)
    *   **Kamino Ward** (Kamino)
    *   **Nabu Island** (Naboo)
    *   **Aldera Junior High** (Alderaan)
*   **Geopolitical Stability:** Despite 200 years of "Quirk chaos" that caused many governments to collapse, the physical borders of most real-world countries remain largely unchanged in the *My Hero Academia* lore.

## Power System
The power system in *My Hero Academia* is centered around **Quirks**, innate superhuman abilities that have fundamentally reshaped human society. Below is a detailed breakdown of the mechanics, rules, limitations, and progression of this system.

### 1. Mechanics & Biology
Quirks are biological functions, much like a muscle or a limb. They are not magical; they are rooted in the user's genetics and physical constitution.
*   **The Quirk Factor:** This refers to the collective physical and genetic traits that allow a Quirk to function. It includes the "primary" power and the "secondary" biological adaptations (e.g., a fire-breather having heat-resistant throat tissues).
*   **Manifestation:** Quirks typically manifest by the age of four. They are hereditary, usually manifesting as one of the parents' Quirks or a "composite" of both (e.g., Shoto Todoroki’s Half-Cold Half-Hot).
*   **The "Quirkless":** Approximately 20% of the population is born without a Quirk. This is identified by a vestigial double-joint in the pinky toe, which is absent in Quirk users.

### 2. Quirk Classifications (Abilities)
Quirks are broadly categorized into three main types based on how they function:
*   **Emitter (Operative):** The most common type. Users can release or control substances/energies (e.g., Bakugo’s *Explosion*, Todoroki’s *Fire/Ice*). These require conscious activation.
*   **Transformation (Composite):** Allows the user to temporarily alter their body (e.g., Kirishima’s *Hardening*, Mt. Lady’s *Gigantification*). These are also active-type abilities.
*   **Mutant (Heteromorphic):** Permanent physical abnormalities that grant abilities (e.g., Tsuyu’s *Frog* physiology, Shoji’s *Dupli-Arms*). These are always "on" and cannot be "erased" by abilities like Aizawa’s *Erasure*.
*   **Accumulation (Sub-type):** Quirks that require the user to stockpile a resource (power, sugar, fat, or even stress) to function (e.g., Fat Gum’s *Fat Absorption*, Eri’s *Rewind*).

### 3. Rules & Laws
*   **One Person, One Quirk:** Naturally, a human body is designed to house only one Quirk Factor.
    *   **Exceptions:** **All For One** (can steal/grant multiple Quirks) and **One For All** (a stockpiling Quirk that absorbs the Quirks of previous users).
*   **The Nomu Rule:** Artificially giving a normal person multiple Quirks usually results in "brain death" or becoming a mindless "Nomu" because the human brain cannot handle the sensory and biological load of multiple Quirk Factors.
*   **Quirk Marriage:** A controversial social practice where individuals marry solely to combine powerful Quirks in their offspring, as seen with Endeavor.

### 4. Limitations & Drawbacks
Because Quirks are biological, they have "hard" physical limits:
*   **Physical Strain:** Overusing an Emitter Quirk can cause physical injury (e.g., Bakugo’s arm strain, Kaminari "short-circuiting" his brain).
*   **Environmental Factors:** Some Quirks are dependent on or weakened by the environment (e.g., Tokoyami’s *Dark Shadow* becomes uncontrollable in total darkness and weak in bright light).
*   **Resource Depletion:** Accumulation types fail if the user runs out of their stored resource (e.g., Momo Yaoyorozu needs body fat to create objects).
*   **Quirk Singularity Theory:** A looming doomsday theory stating that as Quirks mix and evolve over generations, they will eventually become too complex and powerful for the human body to contain, leading to a collapse of the species.

### 5. Progression & Growth
Characters do not just "level up"; they train their Quirks like athletes:
*   **Quirk Training:** By pushing a Quirk to its absolute limit repeatedly (e.g., the Training Camp arc), users can increase their "capacity," similar to hypertrophy in weightlifting.
*   **Ultimate Moves (Super Moves):** These are specialized techniques developed through rigorous practice to maximize a Quirk's efficiency or power (e.g., Deku’s *Detroit Smash*, Endeavor’s *Prominence Burn*).
*   **Quirk Awakening:** Under extreme emotional stress or life-threatening trauma, a Quirk can undergo a sudden, permanent evolution, gaining new properties (e.g., Shigaraki’s *Decay* spreading through indirect contact).
*   **Support Items:** Technology is used to bypass biological limits (e.g., Aoyama’s belt to focus his laser, Bakugo’s bracers to store sweat for larger blasts).

### 6. Power Tiers
While there is no numerical "power level" system like in *Dragon Ball*, the series uses social and professional hierarchies:
*   **Pro Hero Rankings:** Based on a combination of incident resolution, contribution to society, and public popularity (e.g., No. 1 Hero).
*   **Villain Threat Levels:** Often categorized by the scale of destruction they can cause (e.g., "High-End" Nomu).
*   **Official Stats:** The *Ultra Analysis* guidebook ranks characters in categories like **Power, Speed, Technique, Intelligence, and Cooperativeness** on a scale of A to F (with S+ for god-tier characters like All Might).

## Tone
*My Hero Academia* (MHA) is a complex series that evolves significantly over its run. While it begins as a vibrant, optimistic superhero story, it gradually deconstructs its own world, moving into much darker territory while maintaining a core of hope.

### **1. Genre and Atmosphere**
*My Hero Academia* is primarily a **Shonen Action-Adventure** and **Superhero** series, heavily influenced by **Western Silver Age comics** (like *Superman* or *Spider-Man*).
*   **Initial Atmosphere:** Bright, colorful, and academic. The early seasons focus on the "U.A. High School" setting, creating a **Coming-of-Age** atmosphere where the stakes are mostly about exams, sports festivals, and personal growth.
*   **Evolving Atmosphere:** As the series progresses, the atmosphere shifts toward a **War Drama**. The "Dark Hero" and "Paranormal Liberation War" arcs replace the school setting with a crumbling, lawless society, shifting the visual palette to grittier, more realistic tones.

### **2. Tone: The Balance of Optimism and Darkness**
The series is famous for its "tonal whiplash," moving between lighthearted school life and brutal, high-stakes conflict.
*   **Optimism:** MHA is fundamentally optimistic. Its core message is that **"anyone can be a hero"** through perseverance and kindness. This is embodied by the protagonist, Izuku Midoriya (Deku), whose unwavering "will to save" serves as the series' moral compass.
*   **Darkness:** Beneath the glitz of hero society lies a "dark underbelly." The series explores mature themes such as **eugenics** (Quirk marriages), **child abuse** (the Todoroki family), **discrimination** (against those with "villainous" or no Quirks), and the **corruption** of the Hero Public Safety Commission.

### **3. Themes**
*   **What it Means to be a Hero:** The series constantly questions if being a hero is about fame and power or selfless sacrifice.
*   **Legacy and "Passing the Torch":** The relationship between All Might and Deku explores the burden of expectations and the transition of power between generations.
*   **Societal Flaws:** MHA critiques a society that relies too heavily on a single "Symbol of Peace," showing how the neglect of outcasts (villains) leads to systemic collapse.

### **4. Dark Comedy and Humor**
While not a "dark comedy" in the traditional sense, MHA uses humor to provide levity in grim situations.
*   **Character-Driven Gags:** Much of the comedy is based on exaggerated personality traits, such as **Bakugo’s** explosive temper, **Shoto’s** unintentional deadpan nature, or **Iida’s** robotic arm gestures.
*   **Subversion of Expectations:** Humor often arises from "breaking the tension." For example, during the high-stakes battle against Shigaraki, the hero **Mirio Togata** uses a literal "butt" joke as a tactical distraction—a moment of **absurdist humor** in a life-or-death scenario.
*   **Villainous "Black Comedy":** Characters like **Toga Himiko** and **Twice** often exhibit a twisted, manic humor that highlights their fractured mental states, making their scenes both funny and deeply unsettling.

### **5. Mood**
The mood of *My Hero Academia* is best described as **Inspirational yet Stressful**.
*   **Triumphant:** Iconic moments (often accompanied by the track *"You Say Run"*) create a mood of pure adrenaline and triumph.
*   **Bleak:** In later arcs, the mood becomes one of **dread and exhaustion**, particularly during the "Dark Hero" arc where Deku becomes a ragged, solitary figure, reflecting the heavy toll of heroism.
*   **Bittersweet:** The series often concludes major arcs with a sense of "the agony of victory," where the heroes win but at a devastating personal or societal cost.

## Factions
In the world of *My Hero Academia*, society is structured around the management and regulation of "Quirks" (superpowers). This has led to the rise of complex organizations, from government-sanctioned hero agencies to underground revolutionary armies.

### **1. Hero Organizations & Factions**
The hero side is divided into educational institutions, private businesses (agencies), and government regulatory bodies.

*   **Hero Public Safety Commission (HPSC):** The primary governing body in Japan. They manage hero licensing, the Hero Billboard Chart (rankings), and coordinate with the police. They are known for a "dark side," having historically employed assassins like **Lady Nagant** and **Hawks** to eliminate threats to the status quo.
*   **Hero Schools:** The training ground for future pros.
    *   **U.A. High School:** The top-ranked school in Japan, home to Class 1-A and the "Big Three."
    *   **Shiketsu High School:** U.A.'s primary rival in the west, known for strict discipline.
    *   **Ketsubutsu Academy:** Another prominent school that competes in the Provisional License Exam.
*   **Hero Agencies:** Private companies run by Pro Heroes.
    *   **Endeavor Agency:** Currently the most powerful, employing over 30 sidekicks (the "Flaming Sidekickers").
    *   **Nighteye Agency:** Founded by Sir Nighteye (All Might’s former sidekick), specializing in foresight and investigation.
    *   **Ryukyu Agency:** Led by the No. 10 hero, focusing on rescue and aerial combat.
    *   **Team Idaten:** A large agency run by the Iida family (Ingenium), known for its massive roster of sidekicks.

### **2. Villain Organizations & Enemies**
Villains range from small street gangs to massive ideological armies.

*   **League of Villains (LOV):** Founded by **All For One** and led by **Tomura Shigaraki**. Their goal was the total destruction of hero society. Key members include Dabi, Himiko Toga, and Twice.
*   **Meta Liberation Army (MLA):** A massive underground organization with over 100,000 members. They believe Quirks (which they call "Meta Abilities") should be used freely without government regulation. Led by **Re-Destro**, the CEO of Detnerat.
*   **Paranormal Liberation Front (PLF):** The result of the LOV defeating and absorbing the MLA. This is the most powerful villain alliance in history, structured into color-coded regiments (e.g., Carmine for intel, Violet for warfare) led by Shigaraki’s lieutenants.
*   **Shie Hassaikai:** A Yakuza syndicate led by **Overhaul** (Kai Chisaki). They sought to restore the Yakuza's power by developing Quirk-destroying bullets derived from a young girl named Eri.
*   **Humarise:** A global cult (featured in *World Heroes' Mission*) led by **Flect Turn**. They believe in the **Quirk Singularity Doomsday Theory**—the idea that Quirks will eventually become too powerful for the human body to handle, leading to extinction. They seek to "purify" the world by killing all Quirk users.

### **3. World Powers & International Alliances**
While the story is centered in Japan, the series establishes a global geopolitical landscape.

*   **World Heroes Association (WHA):** An international body that coordinates heroes across borders. During global crises (like the Humarise threat), they organize joint operations between nations.
*   **International Heroes:**
    *   **United States:** Home to **Star and Stripe** (Cathleen Bate), the world’s strongest female hero and the U.S. No. 1. The U.S. is noted as the birthplace of the hero licensing system (the Rhode Island State Statute).
    *   **Other Nations:** Notable heroes include **Big Red Dot** (Singapore), **Salaam** (Egypt), and **Pankration** (Greece).
*   **Geopolitics:** The series reveals that a nation's "Hero Power" is directly tied to its national security. Many countries are hesitant to send aid to Japan during the Final War because losing their top heroes would leave them vulnerable to their own domestic crime syndicates.

### **4. Vigilantes & Fringe Groups**
These groups operate outside the law, often in a moral gray area.

*   **Naruhata Vigilantes:** The focus of the prequel series *My Hero Academia: Vigilantes*. Members like **The Crawler**, **Pop☆Step**, and **Knuckleduster** protect their local neighborhood without licenses.
*   **Creature Rejection Clan (CRC):** A hate group that targets individuals with "heteromorph" (non-human looking) Quirks. They represent the deep-seated social prejudices still present in the world.
*   **Villain Factory:** A mysterious organization from the prequel that distributes "Trigger," a drug that boosts Quirk power while inducing a berserker state, used to create "Instant Villains."

### **Summary of Major Alliances & Conflicts**
| Alliance/Conflict | Factions Involved | Outcome/Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kamino Incident** | Heroes/Police vs. LOV | All Might retires; All For One imprisoned. |
| **Shie Hassaikai Raid** | Nighteye/Ryukyu/U.A. vs. Yakuza | Yakuza dismantled; Overhaul defeated. |
| **Deika City War** | LOV vs. Meta Liberation Army | LOV wins; merger creates the **PLF**. |
| **Paranormal Liberation War** | All Japan Pros/U.A. vs. PLF | Massive casualties; society collapses into chaos. |
| **Final War** | International Heroes/U.A. vs. All For One | Final showdown for the future of humanity. |

## Arcs, Sequels, Adaptations, Recent
As of January 2026, *My Hero Academia* has officially concluded its main story in both manga and anime formats, but the franchise continues through spinoffs and special projects. Below is a detailed breakdown of the series' arcs, adaptations, and current status.

### 1. Major Story Arcs & Timeline Progression
The story follows Izuku Midoriya's journey from a "Quirkless" boy to the world's greatest hero. The timeline is primarily divided into three major sagas:

### 2. Sequels, Spinoffs, and Continuity
*   **My Hero Academia: Vigilantes (Prequel):** Set 5 years before the main series. It follows Koichi Haimawari, a "gentle" vigilante. It provides critical backstory for characters like Eraser Head and Stain. **Current Status:** The anime adaptation’s **Season 2 premiered in January 2026**.
*   **My Hero Academia: Team-Up Missions:** A spinoff manga featuring side stories where U.A. students team up with Pro Heroes for specific missions.
*   **My Hero Academia: Smash!!:** A non-canon gag manga featuring chibi versions of the characters.
*   **Movies (Semi-Canon):** *Two Heroes*, *Heroes Rising*, *World Heroes' Mission*, and *You're Next*. These are generally considered canon to the timeline but rarely impact the main manga plot directly.

### 3. Manga vs. Anime: Key Differences
While Studio Bones is praised for its faithful adaptation, several differences exist:
*   **Censorship:** The manga is significantly more graphic (e.g., Shigaraki’s decay effects and the injuries sustained during the Paranormal Liberation War are much more visceral in print).
*   **Pacing & Order:** Season 5 famously swapped the order of the *Endeavor Agency* and *Meta Liberation Army* arcs, which some fans felt rushed the villains' development.
*   **Art Style:** Kohei Horikoshi’s manga art is known for its heavy ink-work and "horror-esque" detail, which is often simplified in the anime for fluid animation.
*   **Added Content:** The anime often adds "filler" scenes that expand on minor characters, such as the extra battles during the Provisional Hero License Exam.

### 4. Latest Events & Ongoing Updates (January 2026)
*   **Manga Conclusion:** The manga officially ended on **August 5, 2024**, with Chapter 430. The final volume (Vol. 42) was released in late 2024 and included a special bonus chapter (Chapter 431) set 8 years after the main story.
*   **Anime Finale:** The main TV series concluded its 8th and final season on **December 18, 2025**, covering the end of the Final War.
*   **2026 Special Episode:** A new special anime episode titled **"More"** has been announced for **May 2, 2026**. It will adapt the "8-year-later" epilogue from Chapter 431, showing Deku and his friends as established Pro Heroes.
*   **Vigilantes Anime:** With the main series over, the focus has shifted to the *Vigilantes* anime, which is currently airing its second season as of **January 2026**.
*   **10th Anniversary:** A global "My Hero Academia in Concert" tour is scheduled to begin in **May 2026** to celebrate a decade of the anime.

## Combat
Combat in *My Hero Academia* (MHA) is a multi-layered system that blends individual superpowers (Quirks) with tactical ingenuity, high-stakes emotional drama, and high-budget visual spectacle. Unlike many "battle shonen" series that rely solely on power levels, MHA emphasizes how a hero’s personality and strategic mind are just as vital as their raw strength.

### 1. The Core Combat System: Quirks & Fighting Styles
The foundation of every battle is the **Quirk**, a unique biological ability. Combat styles are typically categorized by how a hero utilizes their Quirk:
*   **Close-Quarters Combat (CQC):** Heroes like **Mirko** (Rabbit) and **Deku** (One For All) rely on physical enhancement and martial arts. Deku’s evolution from "Full Cowl" (distributing power throughout his body) to "Shoot Style" (focusing on kicks to protect his arms) is a prime example of a fighting style adapting to physical limitations.
*   **Long-Range & Zone Control:** Characters like **Shoto Todoroki** (Half-Cold Half-Hot) and **Endeavor** (Hellflame) dominate the battlefield with massive elemental attacks, forcing opponents to navigate hazardous environments.
*   **Support & Capture:** Heroes like **Eraser Head** (Erasure) and **Best Jeanist** (Fiber Master) focus on neutralizing threats or restraining villains rather than direct damage, often acting as the "tactical anchor" for a team.

### 2. Tactical Depth & Quirk Synergy
Tactics in MHA often revolve around **Quirk Synergy**—combining two or more abilities to create an effect greater than the sum of its parts.
*   **Environmental Interaction:** In the Sports Festival, **Ochaco Uraraka** used the debris from Bakugo’s explosions to create a "Meteor Storm," turning the battlefield itself into a weapon.
*   **Team Tactics:** During the War Arcs, heroes used **Denki Kaminari** as a "human lightning rod" to absorb massive electrical attacks, protecting the front line. Another example is the synergy between **Aizawa** (erasing quirks) and **Shinso** (brainwashing), where they use the same binding cloth technique to confuse and capture enemies.
*   **Counter-Play:** Battles are often a game of "rock-paper-scissors." For instance, **Bakugo** uses his explosions to propel himself through the air, effectively countering ground-based or slower opponents by maintaining a mobility advantage.

### 3. Emotional Weight: The "Heart" of the Fight
The series' most famous battles are defined by their emotional stakes rather than just the action.
*   **Ideological Clashes:** Fights are often "conversations" between opposing worldviews. In **Deku vs. Todoroki**, the battle wasn't just about winning; it was about Deku forcing Todoroki to accept his own power and move past his trauma.
*   **Legacy & Sacrifice:** The **All Might vs. All For One** battle in Kamino Ward is widely considered the emotional peak of the series. It represented the "passing of the torch" and the literal end of an era, where All Might’s dwindling embers of power were fueled by his sense of duty to his students.
*   **Personal Growth:** Fights like **Bakugo vs. Deku (Round 2)** serve as a release valve for years of repressed guilt and rivalry, using combat as a medium for character atonement.

### 4. Flashy Spectacle: The "Plus Ultra" Factor
Studio Bones (the animation studio) is renowned for elevating MHA’s combat into a visual spectacle, particularly through the use of **"Sakuga"** (high-quality animation sequences).
*   **The "Nakamura Cubes":** Legendary animator Yutaka Nakamura often handles the series' biggest moments, characterized by "cubed" debris, high-contrast lighting, and exaggerated perspective that makes impacts feel "earth-shattering."
*   **Ultimate Moves:** These are the "flashy finishers" of the series.
    *   **United States of Smash:** All Might’s final, desperate punch that creates a literal tornado of pressure.
    *   **Prominence Burn:** Endeavor’s concentrated beam of fire that represents his absolute peak as the Number One Hero.
    *   **1,000,000% Delaware Detroit Smash:** Deku’s limit-breaking attack against Muscular, which utilized vibrant, jagged line-work to convey the sheer strain on his body.

### Summary of Iconic Battles
