  name: Titan Powers (The Nine Titans)
  mechanics: A biological and metaphysical network rooted in 'The Paths,' a transcendental
    dimension connecting all Subjects of Ymir. This network allows for the instantaneous
    transfer of mass to form Titan bodies, memories of past and future inheritors,
    and commands from the Founding Titan. Transformation is triggered by physical
    injury (blood loss) combined with a specific mental goal.
  limitations: The Curse of Ymir restricts Shifters to a 13-year lifespan after inheriting
    their power. The Founding Titan's full power is generally restricted to those
    of royal blood. If a Shifter dies without being eaten, their power is randomly
    transferred to a newborn Eldian baby via the Paths.
