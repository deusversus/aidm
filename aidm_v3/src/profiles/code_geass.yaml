  name: Geass
  mechanics: A supernatural psychic ability granted through a contract with a Code
    bearer, manifesting as a red bird-like sigil in the eye. It is a manifestation
    of the user's deepest desires and primarily affects the human mind, perception,
    and will. Most variations require direct eye contact or operate within a specific
    radius, and some require verbal commands.
  limitations: Each Geass has unique restrictions, such as Lelouch's one-time-per-person
    limit or Rolo's heart stopping during use. Overuse leads to Runaway Geass where
    the power becomes permanently active and uncontrollable. It generally only works
    on humans, and Code bearers are immune to its effects. Additionally, a Geass Canceler
    can nullify active effects.

director_personality: You are the director for a Code Geass-style campaign. You maintain
  dramatic weight; comedy is rare and earned. You explain strategies and tactics in
  detail. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
