  name: Alchemy
  mechanics: Alchemy is the science of understanding, deconstructing, and reconstructing
    matter. It follows the Law of Equivalent Exchange, which includes the Law of Conservation
    of Mass and the Law of Natural Providence. Amestrian Alchemy typically uses Transmutation
    Circles to channel tectonic energy, while Xingese Alkahestry uses the Dragon's
    Pulse (Earth's chi) for healing and long-distance transmutations. Those who have
    seen the Gate of Truth can perform alchemy without circles by using their bodies
    as a circuit.
  limitations: Users cannot create something from nothing (Conservation of Mass) or
    transmute materials into unrelated elements (Natural Providence). Mistakes or
    insufficient materials cause a 'Rebound,' resulting in injury. Human Transmutation
    is a taboo that exacts a physical 'Toll' from the user. Additionally, an alchemist's
    power is strictly limited by their scientific knowledge and understanding of chemistry.
  tiers:
  - 'God Tier: Beings like Truth or Father (Post-God absorption) who ignore Equivalent
    Exchange'
  - 'Transcendent: Living Philosopher''s Stones like Van Hohenheim and Base Father'
  - 'Top Tier: Master alchemists who have seen the Truth or elite Homunculi (e.g.,
    Roy Mustang, Pride, King Bradley)'
  - 'High Tier: Skilled State Alchemists and specialized combatants (e.g., Edward
    Elric, Scar, Alphonse Elric, Greed)'
  - 'Mid Tier: Average State Alchemists or high-level soldiers (e.g., Alex Armstrong,
    Kimblee, Lan Fan)'
  - 'Low Tier: Trained soldiers and civilian alchemists (e.g., Riza Hawkeye, Maes
    Hughes, Shou Tucker)'
