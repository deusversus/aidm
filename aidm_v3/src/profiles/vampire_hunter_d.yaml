  name: Super-Science and Sorcery (The Black Arts)
  mechanics: A hybrid system where high-level science and magic are indistinguishable.
    It utilizes genetic engineering, mathematical prophecy, and soul manipulation.
    The ultimate mechanic involves the Akashic Records, a primordial dimension containing
    all information of existence, allowing users to rewrite reality, fate, and causality.
  limitations: Vulnerabilities include Sunlight Syndrome (Heat Syndrome), the biological
    need for blood (The Thirst), and standard weaknesses like garlic or crosses for
    lesser beings. Additionally, the race is bound by Entropy, a scientific prophecy
    dictating their inevitable decline.
  tiers:
  - Street/City (Enhanced physicals, basic regeneration)
  - Continental (Weather mastery, high-tech weaponry)
  - Universal (4D space mastery, pocket universe creation)
  - Multiversal+ (Akashic Records manipulation, conceptual erasure)
