  name: Spiritual Ecology & The Curse
  mechanics: A system rooted in Shinto animism where the natural world (Kami) interacts
    with the human world. The Curse (Tatari-gami) manifests as parasitic 'demon worms'
    born from hatred and pain, granting the host supernatural physical abilities like
    enhanced strength and speed while slowly consuming their life force. The Great
    Forest Spirit acts as the apex, capable of healing or taking life with a touch.
  limitations: The curse is terminal, spreading further across the body whenever the
    host feels anger or uses the granted power. Ancient gods, while powerful, are
    vulnerable to iron weapons and industrial technology. The Forest Spirit's power
    is neutral and indifferent to human morality, making it unpredictable.
  tiers:
  - 'Tier 1: The Great Forest Spirit (Shishigami)'
