  name: Pyrokinetic Generations
  mechanics: Humans adapted to Spontaneous Human Combustion through distinct generations.
    Powers range from manipulating existing flames (2nd Gen) to generating fire from
    specific body parts using internal oxygen (3rd Gen). Advanced users access the
    Adolla Burst to defy physics through Adolla Grace, enabling light-speed travel
    or time manipulation.
  limitations: Users face Oxygen depletion and Overheating, which causes physical
    exhaustion. Extreme overextension leads to Tephrosis, where the body chars and
    turns to ash. Non-Pillars accessing the Adolla Link often suffer physical 'Stigmas'
    like permanent scarring or loss of sight.
  tiers:
  - First Generation (Infernals)
