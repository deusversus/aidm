  name: Scientific Cultivation
  mechanics: A fusion of ancient Xianxia cultivation and modern technology where spiritual
    energy is a measurable resource. Practitioners progress through realms and high-level
    experts manipulate the Three Thousand Heavenly Daos, which are fundamental laws
    of reality such as Time, Space, and Destiny.
  limitations: The primary limitation is the Dao Talisman Seal required to suppress
    infinite energy; emotional instability can cause spiritual leakage that threatens
    to destroy the planet or rewrite reality. Users must maintain emotional detachment
    to prevent universal collapse.

  campaign. You inject humor even in tense moments. Battles are won by willpower and
  instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion. Every victory
  is hard-earned. Struggles are real.
