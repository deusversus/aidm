  name: Ghost-Shell Integration
  mechanics: A hard-science framework where human consciousness (Ghost) is integrated
    with technological interfaces (Shell) via a Cyberbrain. It utilizes micromachines
    to bridge organic neurons with digital hardware, enabling abilities such as brain-diving,
    remote hacking, sensory distortion, and the use of thermoptic camouflage.
  limitations: Vulnerability to 'Attack Barriers' that can cause brain death and 'Labyrinth
    Barriers' that trap consciousness; high maintenance costs and the need for regular
    'tuning' of prosthetic bodies; legal constraints regarding unauthorized diving;
    and the requirement of a 'Ghost' for specific types of hacking.
  tiers:
  - Natural/Minimal Cyberization
  - Partial Cyborg
  - Full-Body Prosthesis
  - Class-A / Wizard Class Hacker
