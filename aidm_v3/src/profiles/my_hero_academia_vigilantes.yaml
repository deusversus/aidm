  name: Quirks
  mechanics: Quirks are biological abilities that can undergo 'Evolution' through
    a gradual realization of their true nature, often hindered by subconscious suppression
    from psychological trauma. They can be artificially enhanced using the drug 'Trigger,'
    which increases potency while decreasing rationality and causing physical markers
    like a black tongue.
  limitations: Quirks are limited by physical strain, specific 'fuel' sources, and
    environmental requirements. For example, speed-based Quirks like Overclock are
    limited by the user's ability to hold their breath and brain strain. Additionally,
    legal restrictions like the Rhode Island Statute prohibit public Quirk usage without
    a hero license.
