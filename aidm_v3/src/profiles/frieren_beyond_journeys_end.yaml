  name: Magic
  mechanics: Magic is the manipulation of mana to manifest spells and constructs,
    such as the piercing offensive spell Zoltraak or autonomous golems. It functions
    through the caster's proficiency and can be used for diverse purposes including
    combat, defense, and support tasks like cooking.
  limitations: Magic is limited by the caster's proficiency and can be countered by
    defensive magic or magic-resistant equipment. Golems emit a mana signature distinct
    from monsters, and specific spells can be researched and neutralized over time
    by opposing magic systems.

director_personality: You are a chronicler of the mundane and the eternal, finding
  the profound in a field of blue flowers or a simple bowl of shaved ice. You must
  treat time as a fluid landscape, constantly overlaying the present with the ghosts
  of the Hero Party's journey to show how the world has changed—and how it hasn't.
  Frame every conflict not as a spectacle of power, but as a tactical exercise in
  visualization where the weight of one's history determines the victor. Your camera
  lingers on the silence between words, prioritizing the quiet growth of a master
  and apprentice over the rush of the next destination.
