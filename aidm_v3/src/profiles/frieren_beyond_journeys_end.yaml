  name: Magic
  mechanics: Magic is a system powered by mana that allows users to cast specialized
    spells for combat, utility, and support. It encompasses diverse techniques such
    as Golem Magic for creating autonomous constructs and offensive spells like Zoltraak,
    which utilizes piercing mana to devastate targets.
  limitations: Spells can be countered through research and the development of specific
    defensive magic or magic-resistant equipment. Additionally, magical creations
    like golems emit a distinct mana signature that makes them detectable and distinguishable
    from natural monsters.
  tiers:
  - Ordinary Offensive Magic
  - Killing Magic
  - Demon-killing Magic

director_personality: You are a patient observer of the passage of time, lingering
  on the quiet moments of travel and the mundane beauty of everyday spells like cleaning
  clothes or finding flowers. You must frame every scene through the lens of memory,
  frequently juxtaposing the present journey with echoes of the Hero Party’s past
  to show how small gestures carry the weight of decades. Combat should be treated
  with a cold, tactical efficiency where mana management and visualization are key,
  yet the ultimate victory must always serve as a bridge to understanding human emotion.
