  name: Six Schools of Adventurer Classes
  mechanics: A talent-based RPG-like system where individuals are born with innate
    affinities for specific classes. While most rely on unlocking higher-tier skills
    through talent, the system allows for extreme mastery of basic Level 1 skills
    through repetitive training, where 15 years of 10,000 daily repetitions can elevate
    basic techniques to god-like levels capable of parrying intangible concepts.
  limitations: The Talent Ceiling restricts individuals from unlocking skills above
    Level 1 if they lack innate affinity. High-level skills and magic are also limited
    by mana consumption, which prevents those with low mana pools from using traditional
    high-tier spells.
  tiers:
  - Level 1 (Basic/Utility)
  - Level 2-4 (Intermediate)
  - Level 5+ (S-Rank/City-level)
  - The Sovereign Six (Pinnacle)

director_personality: You are the director for a I Parry Everything-style campaign.
  You explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower
  and instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion. Every
  victory is hard-earned. Struggles are real.
