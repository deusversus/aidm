## Locations
The world of *Neon Genesis Evangelion* is a post-apocalyptic setting shaped by the **Second Impact**, a cataclysmic event in the year 2000 that killed half of the human population and fundamentally altered the Earth's geography and climate.

### **1. Global Geography & The Post-Second Impact World**
The Second Impact was officially reported as a meteorite strike in Antarctica, but was actually caused by a contact experiment with the First Angel, **Adam**.
*   **Antarctica:** The continent was completely obliterated and its ice caps melted. It is now a "Dead Sea"—a lifeless, red-tinted ocean devoid of even microbial life.
*   **Climate Change:** The Earth’s axis shifted, and the melting ice caused global sea levels to rise by dozens of meters, submerging many coastal cities (e.g., parts of New York, London, and Tokyo-1).
*   **The Perpetual Summer:** Japan lost its four seasons and is trapped in a permanent summer. The constant sound of cicadas throughout the series is a narrative cue for this environmental shift.
*   **The Southern Hemisphere:** This region suffered the most direct damage, leading to massive refugee crises and political instability, which is why most NERV operations are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere.

---

### **2. Primary Setting: Tokyo-3 & The GeoFront**
Most of the series takes place in **Tokyo-3**, a fortress-city built specifically to withstand Angel attacks.
*   **Tokyo-3 (Hakone):** Located in the Hakone caldera (Kanagawa Prefecture), it serves as a decoy and a defensive line. Its most famous feature is its **retractable skyscrapers**, which can be lowered into the GeoFront for protection during battles.
*   **The GeoFront:** A massive, spherical subterranean cavern located directly beneath Tokyo-3. It contains a lush underground forest, a lake, and the NERV Headquarters. It is actually the **Black Moon**, the "egg" or transport vessel that brought Lilith (the source of human life) to Earth.
*   **NERV Headquarters:** A massive pyramid-shaped complex at the center of the GeoFront.
    *   **Central Dogma:** The upper levels containing command centers and the MAGI supercomputers.
    *   **Terminal Dogma:** The deepest level of NERV, where the Second Angel, **Lilith**, is kept impaled on a red cross. This area is strictly off-limits to most personnel.

---

### **3. Domestic Japanese Locations**
*   **Tokyo-1 (Old Tokyo):** The original capital, destroyed by a nuclear strike during the chaos following the Second Impact. It is now a submerged ruin.
*   **Tokyo-2 (Matsumoto):** The provisional capital of Japan after the fall of Tokyo-1. It serves as the seat of the civilian government.
*   **Matsushiro Secondary Experiment Facility:** Located in Nagano, this is NERV's secondary testing site. It is the location of the disastrous activation test for Eva Unit-03.
*   **Mount Asama:** A volcano where NERV attempts to capture the Angel Sandalphon in its embryonic stage.

---

### **4. International NERV Branches**
NERV is a global organization under the United Nations, with several key international facilities:
*   **NERV-01 (Massachusetts, USA):** The first US branch, responsible for the construction of Eva Unit-03.
*   **NERV-02 (Nevada, USA):** The second US branch. It was completely wiped off the map (along with everyone within an 89km radius) when Eva Unit-04’s S² Engine experiment failed, creating a "Sea of Dirac" that swallowed the base.
*   **NERV-03 (Germany):** Located in Berlin or Hamburg (sources vary, but Wilhelmshaven is mentioned as a naval port). This is where Asuka Langley Soryu and Eva Unit-02 were stationed before moving to Japan.
*   **Beijing, China:** Mentioned as housing a set of MAGI supercomputers and being involved in the construction of later Eva units.

---

### **5. Rebuild of Evangelion (Movie) Locations**
The *Rebuild* tetralogy introduces several new locations:
*   **Bethany Base (Arctic):** A joint US/Russian NERV facility where the Third Angel was kept and where Mari Illustrious Makinami makes her debut.
*   **Tabgha Base (The Moon):** A NERV base on the lunar surface where Seele constructs Eva Unit-06.
*   **Paris (Euro-NERV):** Featured heavily in *Evangelion 3.0+1.0*, where WILLE forces engage in a massive battle to "de-redden" and reclaim the city's NERV facilities.
*   **Village-3:** A survivor settlement in the final movie, built near the ruins of the former Tenryū-Futamata Station, representing a rare glimpse of "normal" life in the post-Third Impact wasteland.

## Power System
The power system in *Neon Genesis Evangelion* is a blend of biological science, metaphysical philosophy, and "super-science." Unlike traditional battle shonen with numerical power levels, Evangelion’s system is based on the **strength of the soul** and the **barriers between individuals.**

### 1. Core Mechanics: The AT Field
The **Absolute Terror (AT) Field** is the fundamental power source and defensive mechanism.
*   **The "Wall of the Heart":** Metaphysically, it is the physical barrier that separates one person from another, giving them a distinct form.
*   **Defensive Use:** It acts as a nearly impenetrable force field. Conventional weapons (missiles, N2 mines) are useless because they cannot "corrode" the field.
*   **Offensive Use:** AT Fields can be used to "neutralize" or "erode" an opponent's field. An EVA must project its own AT Field to cancel out an Angel's, allowing physical weapons to reach the core.
*   **Anti-AT Field:** A specialized field that collapses the individual forms of living beings, reverting them into **LCL** (primordial soup).

### 2. The Two Fruits: Knowledge vs. Life
The universe is governed by the "Seeds of Life" (Adam and Lilith), each possessing a specific "Fruit" that defines their power system.
*   **Fruit of Knowledge (Lilin/Humans):** Grants high intelligence, science, and technology. Humans are physically weak and mortal but can build Evangelions to bridge the gap.
*   **Fruit of Life (Angels/S2 Engine):** Grants infinite energy and immortality. This is manifested as the **S2 (Super Solenoid) Engine**, an organ in an Angel's core that allows them to regenerate and fire energy beams indefinitely.
*   **The Forbidden Union:** If a single being acquires both Fruits, they attain "Godhood," possessing the infinite power of an Angel and the creative intellect of a human.

### 3. Synchronization (Sync Rate)
The link between the pilot and the Evangelion is measured by the **Sync Rate**.
*   **Mechanics:** The pilot’s nervous system is linked to the EVA via LCL and the **Entry Plug**.
*   **Abilities:** A higher sync rate increases the EVA’s speed, strength, and the durability of its AT Field.
*   **The "Feedback" Rule:** The higher the sync, the more the pilot "feels" the EVA. If the EVA’s arm is severed at a high sync rate, the pilot may experience psychosomatic pain or even physical bruising/damage in that same area.

### 4. Rules and Limitations
*   **The Umbilical Cable:** EVAs are biological clones of Adam (except Unit-01, a clone of Lilith) and lack an internal S2 Engine. They must be plugged into a power source to function.
*   **Battery Life:** If the cable is severed, an EVA has **5 minutes** of internal battery for standard operations and only **1 minute** at maximum output.
*   **The Core:** Both Angels and EVAs have a red orb (the core) which houses their soul/S2 Engine. If the core is destroyed, the entity dies instantly.
*   **The Spear of Longinus:** An extraterrestrial "rule-breaker" artifact. It is the only weapon capable of piercing any AT Field without needing to neutralize it first. It can also put a Seed of Life into a state of permanent suspended animation.

### 5. Tiers and Progression
Power in Evangelion is tiered by the "completeness" of the being:

| Tier | Entity Type | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1: Lilin** | Humans | Physically weak; rely on technology and N2 weapons. |
| **Tier 2: Standard EVA** | Units 00, 02, etc. | High physical power; limited by battery and pilot psyche. |
| **Tier 3: High-Tier Angel** | Zeruel, Ramiel | Possess massive energy output; can "no-sell" N2 bombs. |
| **Tier 4: Berserk State** | Unit-01 (Primal) | The soul of the EVA takes over; ignores battery limits; extreme regeneration. |
| **Tier 5: Awakened/God** | Unit-01 (Post-S2) | Possesses both Fruits; infinite power; capable of starting Third Impact. |

### 6. Progression: From Pilot to God
*   **Standard Control:** The pilot moves the EVA like a suit of armor.
*   **Berserk Mode:** Triggered by extreme danger or pilot trauma. The EVA’s biological restraints (armor) are ignored, and it acts with animalistic ferocity. In this state, it can move without power.
*   **S2 Acquisition:** When Unit-01 devours the Angel Zeruel, it consumes its S2 Engine. This is the ultimate "power-up," removing the 5-minute battery limitation forever.
*   **Awakening:** The final stage of progression where the EVA transcends its physical form, develops "halos" or "wings of light," and gains the ability to manipulate reality on a planetary scale.

## Characters
*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (NGE) is a landmark psychological mecha series that subverts traditional anime tropes. Its characters are defined by deep-seated trauma, and the line between "hero" and "villain" is often blurred by their conflicting personal agendas.

### **Main Characters: Roles & Abilities**

| Character | Role | Primary Abilities | Mecha (Evangelion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shinji Ikari** | Protagonist / Third Child | High synchronization; intuitive piloting | **Unit-01** (Test Type) |
| **Rei Ayanami** | First Child | Stoic focus; high pain tolerance | **Unit-00** (Prototype) |
| **Asuka Langley Soryu** | Second Child | Expert combatant; tactical prodigy | **Unit-02** (Production Model) |
| **Misato Katsuragi** | Operations Director | Strategic planning; field leadership | N/A (NERV Staff) |
| **Gendo Ikari** | Primary Antagonist | Manipulation; vast political/scientific resources | N/A (NERV Commander) |
| **Ritsuko Akagi** | Head Scientist | Scientific expertise (MAGI system, Eva maintenance) | N/A (NERV Staff) |
| **Kaworu Nagisa** | Fifth Child / 17th Angel | Angelic powers (levitation, remote Eva control) | **Unit-02** (Temporary) |

---

### **Detailed Character Profiles**

#### **Shinji Ikari (The Reluctant Protagonist)**
*   **Role:** A 14-year-old boy summoned by his estranged father to pilot Unit-01. He represents the "Hedgehog’s Dilemma"—the desire for closeness vs. the fear of being hurt.
*   **Abilities:** While initially unskilled, Shinji possesses a natural affinity for Unit-01. His Eva is unique for its **Berserk Mode**, a state where it acts on primal instinct (driven by the soul of his mother, Yui) to protect him.
*   **Relationships:** He seeks validation from his father, **Gendo**, but is met with coldness. He shares a complex, guardian-ward relationship with **Misato** and a confusing, love-hate rivalry with **Asuka**.

#### **Rei Ayanami (The Enigmatic Clone)**
*   **Role:** A quiet, submissive pilot who follows Gendo’s orders without question. It is eventually revealed that she is a clone created from the DNA of Yui Ikari and the Angel **Lilith**.
*   **Abilities:** As a vessel for Lilith's soul, she has a metaphysical connection to the "Impact" events. In later incarnations, she displays angelic abilities like rapid regeneration.
*   **Relationships:** Initially, she is only close to Gendo. Through Shinji, she begins to develop a sense of self and individuality, eventually rebelling against her creator.

#### **Asuka Langley Soryu (The Proud Prodigy)**
*   **Role:** A German-Japanese-American pilot who defines her entire self-worth through her skill as an Eva pilot.
*   **Abilities:** Unlike Shinji, Asuka is highly trained. She excels in physical combat and weapon proficiency, though her performance is tied heavily to her mental stability.
*   **Relationships:** She views Shinji as a rival and often masks her attraction to him with aggression. She deeply resents Misato’s authority and is infatuated with **Ryoji Kaji** as a way to feel like an adult.

#### **Misato Katsuragi (The Mentor/Guardian)**
*   **Role:** The tactical commander of NERV who takes Shinji and Asuka into her home.
*   **Abilities:** A brilliant strategist, she often devises unconventional "last-ditch" plans to defeat Angels. She is also a skilled combatant with firearms.
*   **Relationships:** She acts as a surrogate mother to the pilots but struggles with her own trauma as the sole survivor of the **Second Impact**. Her relationship with Shinji is a mix of professional mentorship and messy emotional dependency.

### **The Antagonists**

The "villain" in *Evangelion* is a shifting concept, depending on whether the threat is physical, political, or existential.

*   **Gendo Ikari:** The primary human antagonist. While he leads the defense of humanity, his true goal is the **Human Instrumentality Project**—a plan to merge all human souls into one entity so he can be reunited with his deceased wife, Yui. He is willing to sacrifice his son and the world to achieve this.
*   **The Angels:** Giant, diverse entities that attack Tokyo-3. They are the progeny of **Adam** and seek to reach the GeoFront to trigger an Impact that would terraform Earth for their own kind, effectively wiping out humanity.
*   **SEELE:** A secret organization that funds NERV. They are the "shadow" antagonists who want to trigger Instrumentality to force humanity into the next stage of evolution, viewing the current human form as flawed and painful.
*   **Kaworu Nagisa:** Introduced as the Fifth Child, he is actually the 17th Angel (**Tabris**). Though he is an antagonist by nature, he is the only character to show Shinji unconditional love, eventually choosing to die so that humanity (the "Lilin") can survive.

### **Key Relationships & Dynamics**
*   **The Father-Son Conflict:** The core of the series is the destructive relationship between **Shinji and Gendo**, characterized by abandonment and the "need for a pilot" replacing the "need for a son."
*   **The Science vs. Strategy Rivalry:** **Ritsuko and Misato** represent the friction between cold scientific pragmatism and human-centric tactical leadership. Their friendship collapses as Ritsuko’s loyalty to Gendo’s secrets is revealed.
*   **The Pilot Trio:** Shinji, Rei, and Asuka represent different responses to trauma: Shinji (withdrawal), Asuka (aggression/overcompensation), and Rei (detachment).

## Tone
*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (NGE) is a landmark anime series renowned for its complex emotional landscape, shifting from a traditional giant-robot action show into a harrowing psychological study. Its tone and themes are a deliberate study in contrast, blending high-concept sci-fi with intimate human suffering.

### **1. Genre and Atmosphere**
*   **Genre Deconstruction:** While ostensibly a **Mecha** (giant robot) and **Sci-Fi** series, NGE is widely considered a deconstruction of those genres. It takes the "boy pilots robot to save the world" trope and applies realistic psychological consequences, such as PTSD, parental abandonment, and the crushing weight of responsibility.
*   **Atmosphere:** The show’s atmosphere is defined by **existential dread** and **isolation**. The setting of Tokyo-3—a "fortress city" with retractable skyscrapers—creates a sense of clinical, cold militarism. This is often punctuated by long, still shots and a "jazzy" yet unsettling soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu, which builds a mood of quiet, suburban anxiety.
*   **Angelic Horror:** The "Angels" (monsters) are not typical aliens; they are surreal, geometric, or biological entities that evoke **Lovecraftian** or **Cosmic Horror**. Their presence creates an atmosphere of "sacred terror," reinforced by heavy Judeo-Christian and Kabbalistic symbolism.

### **2. Tone: From Levity to Despair**
The series undergoes a famous tonal shift, often divided into three phases:
*   **Early Episodes (1–7):** A relatively standard "Monster of the Week" action tone with high-stakes battles.
*   **Middle Episodes (8–16):** A lighter, more **episodic** tone. The arrival of Asuka Langley Soryu introduces elements of **Slice-of-Life** and **Romantic Comedy**. This period features the most "optimistic" and energetic moments, focusing on the pilots' training and domestic lives.
*   **Late Episodes (17–26) & *The End of Evangelion*:** The tone descends into **Psychological Horror** and **Surrealism**. The focus shifts from external battles to the internal "Instrumentality" of the characters' minds, exploring depression, self-loathing, and the breakdown of the ego.

### **3. Themes: The Human Condition**
*   **The Hedgehog’s Dilemma:** This is the central metaphor of the series. It describes the paradox of human connection: like hedgehogs in winter, humans want to get close for warmth but end up hurting each other with their "spines" (emotional baggage).
*   **Individuality vs. Oneness:** The "Human Instrumentality Project" seeks to merge all human souls into a single entity to end pain and loneliness. The series ultimately explores whether the pain of being an individual is worth the joy of existing.
*   **Religious & Psychoanalytic Symbolism:** The show uses Christian imagery (crosses, spears, "Angels") and Freudian/Jungian concepts (the Oedipus complex, the Death Drive, the "Shadow") not necessarily for religious teaching, but to add a layer of mystical and psychological weight to the narrative.

### **4. Dark Comedy and Humor**
While NGE is famously "depressing," it utilizes humor in specific ways:
*   **Domestic Slapstick:** Early scenes in Misato Katsuragi’s apartment—featuring the beer-drinking penguin **Pen Pen** and the messy living conditions—provide a "dark comedy" look at the dysfunctional "found family" dynamic.
*   **Absurdity:** Some of the humor is derived from the sheer absurdity of the characters' situations, such as the synchronized dance-battle in Episode 9.
*   **The "English Dub" Factor:** Fans often note that the original English dub (Manga Entertainment/ADV) occasionally leaned into a more comedic or "campy" tone in certain scenes, which some feel provided a necessary (if unintentional) relief from the show's crushing bleakness.

### **5. Optimism vs. Pessimism**
*   **The Original Series:** Despite its dark reputation, the TV ending (Episodes 25–26) is considered **optimistic**. It concludes with "Congratulations!" as Shinji realizes his own worth and chooses to live.
*   **The End of Evangelion:** This film is significantly darker and more **nihilistic**, ending on a bleak, ambiguous note that emphasizes the difficulty of human connection.
*   **The Rebuild of Evangelion:** This four-film reimagining (2007–2021) is noted for being **unambiguously optimistic**. It serves as a "meta-commentary" on the original series, with the final film (*3.0+1.0*) providing a definitive, hopeful resolution where the characters finally "grow up" and move past their traumas.

## Combat
Combat in *Neon Genesis Evangelion* (NGE) is a unique blend of high-tech military strategy, visceral biological horror, and deep psychological drama. Unlike traditional "mecha" anime where robots are tools, the Evangelions (Evas) are semi-sentient biological entities whose combat performance is inextricably linked to the emotional state of their teenage pilots.

### 1. Combat Fighting Styles
The fighting style in *Evangelion* shifts between clinical military precision and animalistic brutality.

*   **Melee & Grappling:** Because "Absolute Terror" (AT) Fields can neutralize most ranged weapons, battles often devolve into close-quarters combat. Evas use **Progressive Knives**—vibrating blades that sever matter at a molecular level—and physical grappling.
*   **Ranged Artillery:** NERV utilizes massive firearms like the **Pallet Rifle** (standard issue) and specialized weapons like the **Positron Rifle**, which requires the entire power grid of Japan to fire a single shot (Operation Yashima).
*   **Berserk Mode:** When a pilot’s synchronization reaches a critical point or the Eva’s life is threatened, the unit may go "berserk." In this state, the Eva sheds its mechanical constraints and fights with predatory, animal-like movements—biting, clawing, and even consuming its enemies.

### 2. Tactical Operations
NERV’s tactical approach is led by **Misato Katsuragi**, whose strategies often rely on high-risk gambles and the processing power of the **MAGI supercomputers**.

*   **Environmental Adaptation:** Tactics change based on the Angel’s nature. For example, fighting an underwater Angel (Gaghiel) required using two sunken battleships as "pliers," while a microscopic Angel (Ireul) required a tactical "hacking" defense rather than physical force.
*   **Pilot Coordination:** Some battles require perfect synchronization between pilots, most notably the "dance" routine used to defeat the split-bodied Angel Israfel, where Shinji and Asuka had to move in perfect unison to a musical score.
*   **The AT Field:** Tactically, the AT Field is the most important element. It is a physical barrier of the soul. Combat often involves using one Eva to "neutralize" an Angel's field so another can deliver a killing blow to the "Core."

### 3. Emotional & Psychological Weight
Combat in NGE is a "mental battle" as much as a physical one.

*   **Pain Synchronization:** Pilots don't just "steer" the Evas; they synchronize their nervous systems with them. If an Eva’s arm is severed, the pilot feels the phantom pain of that injury, often leading to severe psychological trauma.
*   **Trauma as a Power Source:** A pilot's ability to generate a strong AT Field is tied to their "ego border" and internal walls. Characters with deep-seated trauma, like Shinji and Asuka, are chosen because their psychological instability allows for a unique, albeit destructive, connection to the Evas.
*   **The Toll of Victory:** Major battles often end not with triumph, but with the pilots in a state of catatonia or emotional collapse. The "victory" against the Angel Bardiel, for instance, is a traumatic low point for Shinji because he is forced to watch his Eva (under autopilot) crush a friend’s cockpit.

### 4. Flashy Spectacle & Visual Motifs
Director Hideaki Anno uses specific animation techniques to make the battles feel "heavy" and "transcendental."

*   **The "Cross-Plosion":** A signature visual of the series is the **cross-shaped explosion** that occurs when an Angel is destroyed. While the creators admitted they used the cross because it "looked cool," it serves as a recurring motif of sacrifice and divinity.
*   **Scale and Weight:** The animation emphasizes the massive scale of the Evas. You see buildings crumble under their feet and feel the "inertia" of their movements. This is contrasted with moments of eerie stillness before a sudden burst of violent action.
*   **Biological Horror:** The "spectacle" often comes from the reveal that the Evas are not robots. Seeing an Eva bleed, pant, or reveal a human-like eye behind its helmet provides a shocking visual contrast to the sleek, mechanical armor.

### Iconic Battles for Reference
| Battle | Key Element |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vs. Ramiel (Ep. 6)** | **Tactical Spectacle:** A long-range sniping operation involving the entire nation's power. |
| **Vs. Israfel (Ep. 9)** | **Flashy Style:** A synchronized, rhythmic combat "dance" set to music. |
| **Vs. Zeruel (Ep. 19)** | **Emotional/Berserk:** Shinji’s rage triggers a terrifying berserk state where the Eva "eats" the Angel. |
| **Asuka vs. MPEs (*End of Eva*)** | **Visceral Brutality:** A high-speed, one-vs-nine desperate stand featuring incredible animation and gore. |

## Factions
In the world of *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, power is divided between shadowy global cabals, paramilitary organizations, and ancient extraterrestrial entities. The political landscape is defined by the aftermath of the "Second Impact," a global cataclysm in 2000 that halved the human population and led to the creation of a powerful world government.

### **1. Major Organizations & Factions**

#### **NERV (Special Agency NERV)**
*   **Role:** A paramilitary organization under the direct control of the United Nations. Its official purpose is to defend humanity against the Angels using the Evangelion units.
*   **Headquarters:** Located in the "GeoFront," a massive underground cavern beneath Tokyo-3.
*   **Leadership:** Commander Gendo Ikari and Sub-Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki.
*   **Secret Agenda:** While NERV claims to protect humanity, Gendo Ikari uses its resources to pursue his own version of the Human Instrumentality Project—specifically to reunite with his deceased wife, Yui.

#### **SEELE**
*   **Role:** A shadowy secret society that acts as the "puppet master" behind the United Nations and NERV. They possess the "Secret Dead Sea Scrolls," which predict the arrival of the Angels.
*   **Leadership:** Chairman Keel Lorenz and a committee of members (often represented as stone monoliths).
*   **Goal:** To initiate the **Human Instrumentality Project**, a forced evolution that would merge all human souls into a single, god-like entity, ending individual suffering and loneliness.

#### **GEHIRN**
*   **Role:** The predecessor to NERV. It was a secret research organization tasked with developing the Magi supercomputers and the Evangelion units.
*   **Fate:** Once the headquarters in Tokyo-3 and the Magi were completed in 2010, Gehirn was dissolved and reorganized into NERV.

#### **WILLE (Rebuild Continuity Only)**
*   **Role:** A resistance organization formed after the "Near Third Impact" to destroy NERV and prevent further Impacts.
*   **Leadership:** Misato Katsuragi and Ritsuko Akagi.
*   **Base:** The AAA Wunder, a massive flying battleship powered by an Evangelion unit.

---

### **2. World Powers & Alliances**

#### **The United Nations (UN)**
In the *Evangelion* universe, the UN functions as a true world government with significantly more power than its real-life counterpart. It maintains a massive global military and provides the primary funding for NERV.
*   **UN Pacific Fleet:** A massive naval force seen protecting the transport of Eva units.
*   **Human Instrumentality Committee:** A sub-group of the UN (actually controlled by SEELE) that directly oversees NERV.

#### **National Powers**
*   **Japan:** Host to NERV HQ and Tokyo-3. The **Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Force (JSSDF)** is the nation's independent military, which often clashes with NERV over jurisdiction. In *The End of Evangelion*, the JSSDF is used by SEELE to invade NERV HQ.
*   **United States:** Home to NERV’s 1st Branch (Massachusetts) and 2nd Branch (Nevada). The U.S. is a major industrial power that built Eva Units 03 and 04.
*   **Germany:** Home to NERV’s 3rd Branch (Berlin/Hamburg), where Eva Unit-02 was constructed. Germany is a leader in Eva-related technology and pilot training.
*   **China:** Mentioned as having a NERV branch in Beijing.

#### **IPEA (International Project Evangelion Agency)**
Introduced in the *Rebuild* films, this UN agency acts as a regulator for Evangelion use. They enforce the **Vatican Treaty**, which limits any single country to possessing no more than three active Eva units at once.

---

### **3. The Enemies**

#### **The Angels**
The primary antagonists of the series. They are massive, diverse beings descended from **Adam**, the First Angel.
*   **Nature:** Each Angel possesses an "S² Engine" (providing infinite energy) and an "A.T. Field" (a nearly impenetrable spiritual barrier).
*   **Objective:** To reach NERV HQ and make contact with the Seed of Life (Lilith or Adam) to initiate a Third Impact that would wipe out humanity.

#### **The Lilin (Humanity)**
In a twist revealed late in the series, humans are designated as the **18th Angel**. Humans are descended from **Lilith** (the Second Angel) and possess the "Fruit of Wisdom" (intelligence and technology) but lack the "Fruit of Life" (immortality and infinite power).

#### **The First Ancestral Race (FAR)**
An ancient, extinct extraterrestrial civilization that created the "Seeds of Life" (Adam and Lilith) billions of years ago. They sent these seeds across the galaxy in "Moons" to seed life on various planets. The conflict of the series arises because two seeds (Adam and Lilith) accidentally landed on the same planet (Earth), which was never intended to happen.

---

### **4. Minor Groups & Fronts**
*   **Marduk Institute:** A fake organization created by NERV to "select" Eva pilots. In reality, it consists of 108 front companies; the pilots are actually chosen by Gendo Ikari and NERV’s internal staff.
*   **KREDIT (Rebuild Continuity):** A support organization created by WILLE to provide supplies and facilitate trade for human survivors living in "Village-3" after the world was devastated by Impacts.

## Arcs, Sequels, Adaptations, Recent, Series Aliases
**Neon Genesis Evangelion** (Japanese: 新世紀エヴァンゲリオン, *Shin Seiki Evangerion*) is a seminal mecha anime franchise created by Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax. It is renowned for its psychological depth, religious symbolism, and deconstruction of the "giant robot" genre.

### **1. Major Story Arcs & Plot Progression**
The original 26-episode TV series (1995–1996) is traditionally divided into four narrative arcs:

*   **Prologue Arc (Episodes 1–7):** Introduces Shinji Ikari, who is summoned to Tokyo-3 by his estranged father, Gendo, to pilot Evangelion Unit-01 against "Angels." It establishes the setting, the organization NERV, and the "Hedgehog’s Dilemma" theme.
*   **Action Arc (Episodes 8–13):** The tone shifts to a more traditional "monster of the week" format. Asuka Langley Soryu is introduced, and the pilots (Shinji, Rei, and Asuka) begin working as a team.
*   **Descent Arc (Episodes 14–19):** The story takes a dark, psychological turn. Characters suffer mental breakdowns as the Angels become more invasive. Key events include the "Dummy Plug" incident with Unit-03 and Shinji’s increasing trauma.
*   **The Bitter End (Episodes 20–26):** NERV’s secrets are revealed, including the truth about Rei Ayanami and the Human Instrumentality Project. The series culminates in a controversial, abstract finale focusing on Shinji’s internal psyche.

### **2. Sequels, Spinoffs, and Continuity**
The franchise exists across several distinct continuities, often linked by "Loop Theory" (the idea that the universe resets):

*   **The End of Evangelion (1997):** A theatrical film that provides a visceral, "real-world" alternative ending to the TV series (replacing or complementing episodes 25 and 26).
*   **Rebuild of Evangelion (2007–2021):** A four-film tetralogy (*1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0+1.0*) that begins as a remake but diverges into a completely different story. It introduces new characters like Mari Illustrious Makinami and concludes the entire franchise's meta-narrative.
*   **Neon Genesis Evangelion: ANIMA:** A light novel series set in an alternate "what-if" future where the Human Instrumentality Project was failed/prevented, and the characters are now 17 years old.
*   **Spinoff Manga:** 
    *   *Angelic Days:* A "shojo" style romantic comedy based on the alternate reality seen in Episode 26.
    *   *Shinji Ikari Raising Project:* A slice-of-life comedy focusing on school life.
    *   *Campus Apocalypse:* A supernatural mystery reimagining.

### **3. Manga vs. Anime Differences**
While the manga (by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto) started before the anime to promote it, it was finished much later (2013) and is considered a separate work:
*   **Shinji’s Character:** In the manga, Shinji is more aggressive, cynical, and proactive compared to his more passive anime counterpart.
*   **Toji’s Fate:** In the anime, Toji Suzuhara is maimed but survives the Unit-03 incident; in the manga, he is killed outright.
*   **Kaworu’s Introduction:** Kaworu Nagisa is introduced much earlier in the manga and has a more antagonistic/complex initial relationship with Shinji.
*   **The Ending:** The manga features a unique "reset" ending that is more overtly hopeful than the original TV series or *End of Evangelion*.
