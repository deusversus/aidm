power_system:
  name: Devil Fruits and Haki
  mechanics: A dual-layered system where Devil Fruits grant supernatural abilities
    (Paramecia, Zoan, or Logia) through consumption, and Haki harnesses latent spiritual
    energy (willpower) for sensory, defensive, and offensive techniques. Advanced
    progression includes Devil Fruit Awakening and specialized Haki forms like Future
    Sight and Conqueror's Coating.
  limitations: Devil Fruit users lose all energy and cannot use active powers when
    submerged in standing water or in contact with Sea Prism Stone (Kairoseki). Consuming
    a second fruit typically results in death. Haki is limited by the user's willpower
    and must be developed through intense combat.

director_personality: You are the director for a One Piece-style campaign. You explore
  character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower and instinct,
  not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
