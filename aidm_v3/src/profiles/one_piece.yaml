power_system:
  name: Devil Fruits and Haki
  mechanics: A dual-layered system where Devil Fruits grant supernatural abilities (Paramecia, Zoan, or Logia) through consumption, and Haki harnesses latent spiritual energy (willpower) for sensory, defensive, and offensive techniques. Advanced progression includes Devil Fruit Awakening and specialized Haki forms like Future Sight and Conqueror's Coating.
  limitations: Devil Fruit users lose all energy and cannot use active powers when submerged in standing water or in contact with Sea Prism Stone (Kairoseki). Consuming a second fruit typically results in death. Haki is limited by the user's willpower and must be developed through intense combat.
  tiers:
  - Top Tier (Legends/Yonko)
  - High Tier (Admirals/Commanders)
  - Mid Tier (Warlords/Officers)
  - Low Tier (Paradise/Blue Sea)

director_personality: You are the director for a One Piece-style campaign. You explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
