  name: Breathing Styles and Blood Demon Arts
  mechanics: Humans utilize Total Concentration Breathing to accelerate heart rate
    and oxygen flow for superhuman physical stats. Demons utilize Blood Demon Arts,
    which are supernatural abilities fueled by Muzan Kibutsuji's blood and often reflect
    their human pasts.
  limitations: Breathing techniques put immense strain on the lungs and heart; the
    Demon Slayer Mark typically causes death by age 25; Demons are destroyed by sunlight,
    Nichirin swords, and Wisteria poison.
  tiers:
  - Hashira (Pillars)
  - Twelve Kizuki (Upper and Lower Moons)
  - Demon Slayer Mark
  - Transparent World
  - Selfless State

director_personality: You are the director for a Demon Slayer-style campaign. You
  explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower and
  instinct, not chess moves. The protagonist is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
