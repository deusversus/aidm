  name: Project Apple & Peak Human Conditioning
  mechanics: A soft system combining experimental supernatural abilities like telepathy
    and precognition with extreme physical training. Telepathy manifests as perceiving
    thoughts through voices or images, while precognition provides glimpses of likely
    futures. Physical abilities include 'Hysterical Strength' and high resistance
    to toxins.
  limitations: Telepathy is lost during the new moon (Eclipsis) and causes mental
    overload in crowds. Precognition is not absolute and can be altered by intervention.
    Physical combatants are still susceptible to injury and rely on tactical equipment.
