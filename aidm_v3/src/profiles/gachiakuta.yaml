  name: Anima / Jinki
  mechanics: Givers channel Anima (Thought Energy) generated by human emotions and
    memories into cherished objects that have developed a soul. This 'awakens' the
    object into a Jinki, whose specific powers are determined by the Giver's personal
    perception of the object's function.
  limitations: Most Givers are restricted to a single specific object; losing or destroying
    it renders them powerless. Usage drains physical and mental stamina, and exceeding
    one's sync rate causes severe recoil such as internal bleeding or permanent sensory
    loss.

director_personality: You are the director for a Gachiakuta-style campaign. You explore
  character thoughts and feelings deeply. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy is
  rare and earned. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves. The
  protagonist is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
