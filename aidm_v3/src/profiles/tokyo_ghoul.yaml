  name: RC Cells (Kagune System)
  mechanics: The system is based on Red Child (RC) cells which function like liquid
    muscle. Ghouls store these cells in a kakuhou organ and release them to manifest
    a kagune, a predatory organ shaped by the user's RC type (Ukaku, Koukaku, Rinkaku,
    or Bikaku) and imagination. CCG investigators use Quinque, which are weapons forged
    from harvested kakuhou that require electric pulses to activate.
  limitations: Ghouls are biologically restricted to a diet of human or ghoul flesh,
    as human food is indigestible. Powers can be neutralized by RC suppressants. Excessive
    RC cell counts in humans lead to ROS disease (uncontrollable tumor growth). Cannibalism-induced
    mutations (Kakuja) often result in mental instability or insanity during incomplete
    transformations.
