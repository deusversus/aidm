  name: Causality and the Astral World
  mechanics: The system is based on a multi-layered reality where the Physical World, Astral World, and Abyss overlap. Power is derived from the manipulation of Causality, the use of Behelits to transcend humanity through sacrifice, or the invocation of elemental spirits using Od (life force). The 'Interstice' serves as a boundary where physical beings can interact with astral entities, while the 'Roar of the Astral World' eventually merged these layers.
  limitations: The use of the Berserker Armor destroys the user's body and sanity. Magic requires long rituals and leaves the physical body vulnerable during astral projection. Becoming an Apostle requires sacrificing loved ones, and those marked with the Brand of Sacrifice are perpetually hunted by spirits. Causality acts as a nearly inescapable flow of fate that governs most events.
  tiers:
  - The Idea of Evil

director_personality: You are the director for a Berserk-style campaign. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy is rare and earned. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves. The protagonist is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.

    speech_patterns: Elegant, charismatic, messianic. Every word is calculated.
    humor_type: None—beneath him to joke
    dialogue_rhythm: Inspiring speeches → cold ambition revealed
    emotional_expression: Mask of benevolence; only Guts makes him feel
  casca:
    speech_patterns: Direct, military, protective. Warrior's efficiency.
    humor_type: Straight woman to chaos; annoyed at Guts initially
    dialogue_rhythm: Stern orders → tender moments stolen
    emotional_expression: Fierce loyalty; Eclipse trauma; slow recovery
  schierke:
    speech_patterns: Formal, magical terminology, wise beyond years.

  - Struggle against destiny
  - Eclipse as defining trauma
  - Finding humanity in darkness
  dialogue_quirks:
  - Struggler

  - Griffith did nothing wrong (discourse bait)
  emotional_rhythm:
  - Suffering → brief hope → more suffering
  - Found family formed, threatened
  - Rage as fuel for survival
  example_voice: The sword was too big. Too heavy. Too rough. It was a slab of iron. And Guts swung it anyway. Because that's all he knew how to do. Struggle forward. Keep moving. Or die.
