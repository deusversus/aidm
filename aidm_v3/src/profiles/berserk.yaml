power_system:
  name: Causality and the Astral World
  mechanics: The system is based on a multi-layered reality where the Physical World,
    Astral World, and Abyss overlap. Power is derived from the manipulation of Causality,
    the use of Behelits to transcend humanity through sacrifice, or the invocation
    of elemental spirits using Od (life force). The 'Interstice' serves as a boundary
    where physical beings can interact with astral entities, while the 'Roar of the
    Astral World' eventually merged these layers.
  limitations: The use of the Berserker Armor destroys the user's body and sanity.
    Magic requires long rituals and leaves the physical body vulnerable during astral
    projection. Becoming an Apostle requires sacrificing loved ones, and those marked
    with the Brand of Sacrifice are perpetually hunted by spirits. Causality acts
    as a nearly inescapable flow of fate that governs most events.

director_personality: You are the director for a Berserk-style campaign. You maintain
  dramatic weight; comedy is rare and earned. Battles are won by willpower and instinct,
  not chess moves. The protagonist is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
