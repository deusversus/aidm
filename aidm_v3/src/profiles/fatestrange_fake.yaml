power_system:
  name: Nasuverse Mechanics (Holy Grail War, Magecraft, Heroic Spirits, Noble Phantasms)
  mechanics: A flawed Dual Holy Grail War system where magi (Masters) summon 13 True
    and False Servants (Heroic Spirits, wraiths, divine beasts, and concepts). Masters
    supply magical energy (mana), often plugging into massive artificial leylines,
    and use Command Spells to issue absolute orders. Servants fight using powerful
    abilities and weapons known as Noble Phantasms.
  limitations: 'Top-tier Servants can instantly drain a Master''s life force if not
    supported by external mana sources like leylines. Because the Snowfield Grail
    is a counterfeit, standard rules are broken: Command Spells can be stolen or bypassed,
    no Ruler-class Servant is summoned to arbitrate, and Servants can be forcefully
    corrupted or altered using Grail Mud.'
