  name: The Dual Ritual (False and True Holy Grail War)
  mechanics: A complex, overlapping summoning system that utilizes the Fuyuki ritual
    framework to manifest 13 Master-Servant pairs. It involves summoning Heroic Spirits,
    conceptual entities like Pestilence, and irregular classes like Watcher. Masters
    provide mana or tap into leylines to fuel 'Noble Phantasms'—powerful crystallized
    mysteries or weapons. The system allows for the 'revision' of mundane objects
    into pseudo-Noble Phantasms and the evolution of humans into new biological phylums
    or living Heroic Spirits.
  limitations: The False Grail is a mana reservoir that cannot grant wishes without
    the completion of the True War. Mana consumption is often erratic and extreme,
    sometimes requiring the drainage of entire city populations. The system is prone
    to 'Mystery' failure, where the scale of destruction makes magical secrecy impossible
    to maintain.
  tiers:
  - 'Tier 0 (World-Threat): Pale Rider, Thia Escardos, Ishtar (Goddess possession)'
  - 'Tier 1 (Top-Class Servants): Gilgamesh, Enkidu, Alcides (Heracles)'
  - 'Tier 2 (High-Tier): Richard I, Hippolyta, True Assassin (Hassan of the Fathomless
    Rift)'
  - 'Tier 3 (Specialized/Support): Alexandre Dumas, Jack the Ripper (Berserker), Hansa
    Cervantes (Executor)'
