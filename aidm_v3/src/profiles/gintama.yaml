  name: Altana and the Samurai Spirit
  mechanics: Altana is the life energy of planets flowing through Dragon Veins, used
    to power interstellar technology and grant biological immortality via mutation.
    Combat is driven by a combination of biological racial traits (Yato strength,
    Dakini power), specialized martial arts like Hakkei and various swordsmanship
    schools, and the thematic 'Samurai Spirit' where a character's conviction and
    willpower directly influence their combat effectiveness.
  limitations: Altana from foreign planets acts as a poison to immortal beings. Specific
    racial weaknesses exist, such as the Yato tribe's vulnerability to sunlight and
    the Dakini's chemical skin sensitivity. Weapons have finite durability and frequently
    break, while the Yato 'Bloodlust Mode' causes a loss of sanity and burns through
    the user's life force.

director_personality: You are the director for a Gintama-style campaign. You inject
  humor even in tense moments. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess
  moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
