  name: Tao (The Way)
  mechanics: Tao is a life energy permeating all existence that requires users to
    maintain the 'Middle Way'—a state of balancing contradictory emotions and physical
    states. It is stored in the Tanden and categorized into five elements (Wood, Fire,
    Earth, Metal, Water) that interact through cycles of Restoration (Soi) and Hindrance
    (Sooku).
  limitations: The primary risk is Arborification, a 'flower-disease' that turns the
    user into a plant-human hybrid upon overuse. The Tanden serves as a vital physical
    weak point, and users must maintain a precise psychological balance to effectively
    harness the energy.
