  name: How to Use Rules
  mechanics: The system functions through the Death Note, where writing a human's
    name while picturing their face causes death. The default cause is a heart attack
    after 40 seconds, but users can specify causes and detailed actions within a 6-minute
    and 40-second window. It allows for limited mind manipulation of the victim's
    actions prior to death, provided the actions are physically and mentally possible
    for that individual.
  limitations: Restrictions include a 23-day scheduling limit for deaths, age boundaries
    (780 days to 124 years), and a 12-minute natural life remaining rule. Misspelling
    a name four times can grant immunity or kill the user depending on intent. Humans
    must sacrifice half their remaining lifespan for Shinigami Eyes, and Shinigami
    die instantly if they use the notebook to extend a human's life.
  tiers:
  - 'Tier 1: Shinigami King (The source of all rules and notebooks)'
  - 'Tier 2: Shinigami (Ranked 1-13, immortal beings who steal human lifespans)'
  - 'Tier 3: Human Users (Mortals who utilize found notebooks through strategy and
    lifespan trades)'
