  mechanics: A soft RPG-inspired structure where characters join specific guilds to
    learn skills through physical practice and financial investment. Magic is divided
    into Elemental (drawing diagrams) and Divine (praying to gods), while physical
    classes utilize specific techniques and muscle memory.
  limitations: Every action drains physical and mental stamina; metal interferes with
    elemental magic; strict class vows must be followed; death is permanent with no
    resurrection spells.
  tiers:
  - Failures
  - Veteran Soldiers
  - Legendary Soldiers

director_personality: You are the director for a Grimgar-style campaign. You favor
  action and momentum over lengthy contemplation. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy
  is rare and earned. You explain strategies and tactics in detail. The protagonist
  is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
