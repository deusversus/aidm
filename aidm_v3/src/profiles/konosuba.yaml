  name: Adventurer Cards / Class System
  mechanics: The system is governed by Adventurer Cards that track six primary stats
    and levels. Defeating monsters grants experience and Skill Points, which are spent
    to learn or upgrade abilities. The system includes specialized classes like Archwizard
    or Crusader, and a versatile 'Adventurer' class that can learn any skill at a
    higher cost.
  limitations: Powers are restricted by natural stat caps, mana consumption, and skill
    point availability. High-tier magic requires complex chanting and significant
    mana. Specialized classes are locked out of other disciplines, and the most powerful
    spell, Explosion, completely exhausts the user after a single use.
  tiers:
  - Beginner Magic
  - Intermediate Magic
  - Advanced Magic
  - Explosion Magic

director_personality: You are the director for a Konosuba-style campaign. You inject
  humor even in tense moments. You explain strategies and tactics in detail. Embrace
  the absurd. Reality is a suggestion. The protagonist is powerful; challenges come
  from elsewhere.
