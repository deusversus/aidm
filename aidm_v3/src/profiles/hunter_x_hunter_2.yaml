  name: Nen
  mechanics: 'Nen is the manipulation of Aura, the life energy flowing from all living
    beings. It is built on the Four Major Principles: Ten (containing aura), Zetsu
    (suppressing aura), Ren (producing large amounts), and Hatsu (personal expression).
    Users have specific affinities—Enhancement, Transmutation, Emission, Conjuration,
    Manipulation, or Specialization—and use advanced techniques like Gyo, En, and
    Ryu for combat.'
  limitations: Power is governed by Vows and Contracts where self-imposed restrictions
    multiply strength; breaking these can result in death. Users face diminishing
    efficiency when using types outside their natural affinity. Techniques like Zetsu
    leave the user defenseless, and the 'Initiation' method of awakening can be fatal.
