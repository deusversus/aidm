  name: Magecraft (Thaumaturgy) and True Magic
  mechanics: Magi utilize Magic Circuits to convert internal life force (Od) or environmental
    energy (Mana) into Prana. This energy is used to fuel 'Foundations'—pre-established
    systems like Runes or Alchemy—to reenact phenomena. A magus's abilities are further
    defined by their innate Origin (fundamental nature) and Element (affinity).
  limitations: The system is restricted by the Principle of Mystery, where power fades
    as science explains phenomena, and Equivalent Exchange, which prevents creating
    something from nothing. Magic Circuits are innate and cannot be increased through
    training. Additionally, the World (Gaia) actively suppresses unnatural phenomena
    like Reality Marbles, and the Counter Force (Alaya) eliminates threats to humanity.
  tiers:
  - Ultimate Ones (Types)

  favor action and momentum over lengthy contemplation. You maintain dramatic weight;
  comedy is rare and earned. You explain strategies and tactics in detail. The protagonist
