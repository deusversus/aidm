## Tone
**Clevatess** (full title: *Clevatess -Majū no Ō to Akago to Shikabane no Yūsha-*) is a dark fantasy Seinen series by Yūji Iwahara. It is known for its unique blend of high-stakes brutality and a surprisingly grounded, character-driven narrative.

### **Genre & Atmosphere**
*   **Genre:** Dark Fantasy, Seinen, Action, Adventure.
*   **Atmosphere:** The series possesses a "vintage" dark fantasy atmosphere reminiscent of 90s and early 2000s classics like *Berserk*, *Claymore*, and *Goblin Slayer*. It feels heavy, lore-rich, and lived-in. The world is indifferent and harsh, often depicted with a "clinical" or "anthropological" lens that observes human suffering without sugarcoating it.

### **Tone**
The tone is **somber and intense**, yet it avoids being purely "grimdark" by maintaining a sense of curiosity. It balances extreme violence and gore with quiet moments of contemplation. It is often described as a "brutal anthropological meditation" because it looks at human society through the eyes of a non-human entity who finds human behavior both fascinating and nonsensical.

### **Themes**
*   **The Nature of Humanity:** The story explores what it means to be human through the protagonist, Clevatess, who observes human hypocrisy, greed, and resilience from an outsider's perspective.
*   **Power and Legitimacy:** It critiques how "heroes" and "kings" are manufactured through sacrifice and secrecy rather than inherent virtue.
*   **Parenthood and Empathy:** A central theme is the transformative power of caring for another. The act of raising a child (Luna) forces the characters to develop empathy and find a reason to preserve a world they otherwise despise.
*   **Morality vs. Indifference:** The clash between Alicia’s rigid human morality and Clevatess’s clinical indifference drives much of the thematic conflict.

### **Dark Comedy**
The comedy in *Clevatess* is **dry, subtle, and often unintentional.**
*   **Fish-out-of-water Humor:** Much of the humor stems from Clevatess’s total ignorance of human biology and social norms. For example, he resurrects a female hero (Alicia) solely to feed the baby, assuming she can "lactate on command" simply because she is female.
*   **Deadpan Delivery:** Clevatess’s matter-of-fact way of describing horrific events or dismissing human "logic" provides a dark, ironic levity that prevents the story from becoming too oppressive.

### **Optimism**
Despite its bleak setting, *Clevatess* contains a core of **guarded optimism.**
*   **The "Gentler Side":** While the world is full of bandits, abuse, and war, the relationship between the core trio (Clevatess, Alicia, and the baby Luna) represents a "found family" dynamic.
*   **Growth and Change:** The optimism lies in the characters' capacity to change. Clevatess, an omnipotent beast who initially wanted to wipe out humanity, begins to "blink in confusion" at his own growing attachment to the child, suggesting that even the most destructive forces can learn to protect.
*   **Luna as Hope:** The infant Luna serves as a literal and symbolic catalyst for hope, forcing the characters to look toward a future rather than just surviving the present.

### **Mood**
The mood is **heart-wrenching and gripping.** It frequently shifts from the visceral horror of a battlefield to the delicate, high-stakes tension of keeping a baby alive in a wasteland. It is a "heavy" read/watch that rewards the audience with deep emotional payoffs and a sense of genuine wonder at the world's mysteries.

---

### **III. Organizations, Factions, and World Powers**

The world of **Edthea** is divided by a "no-man's land" controlled by Dark Beasts, keeping human nations isolated.

#### **1. The Four Lords of Dark Beasts**
The ultimate rulers of the continent’s four cardinal regions.
*   **Clevatess (South):** Resembles a chimera of a lion, ram, and wolf.
*   **Vordein (North):** A multi-eyed dragon; the most overtly antagonistic of the four.
*   **Zavthier (West):** A female Beast King worshipped as a goddess by the Forest People; a master of illusions.
*   **Laswell (East):** An ancient, colossal sea monster; considered the wisest and oldest.

#### **2. The Five Humanoid Races**
The continent is inhabited by five distinct "hominid" peoples:
*   **Hidens:** Inhabitants of the Kingdom of Haiden.

*   **Orggs, Bents, and Sladas:** Other humanoid races with varying cultures and physical traits.

#### **3. Major Kingdoms**
*   **Kingdom of Haiden (Hyden):** A fallen power. Its king foolishly attacked Clevatess, leading to the capital's destruction. It holds the "Forge," the only place capable of creating **Regalia** (anti-beast weapons).
*   **Kingdom of Boelate (Borate):** An aggressive military nation seeking to seize Haiden’s resources (Arcanacites) and the Forge following its collapse.

#### **4. Other Groups**
*   **The 13 Heroes:** A group of elite warriors armed with Regalia weapons. Most were killed by Clevatess in the series' opening.
*   **The Crows:** A ruthless mercenary and slave-trading organization that kidnaps young dark beasts and humans to sell on the black market.
*   **The Forest People:** A group that lives in the Western territories under the protection/worship of Zavthier.

### **IV. Alliances and Enemies**
*   **Alliances:** Clevatess, Alicia, and Nelluru form an "unlikely trio" alliance to protect Luna. Later, a ceasefire is brokered between three human kingdoms (Haiden, Boelate, and Eslinn) after the defeat of Dorel.
*   **Enemies:** Humanity is the historical enemy of the Dark Beasts. However, the true "enemy" shifts to internal human corruption (Boelate's expansionism) and the shadow-scheming of other Beast Kings like Vordein.

## Sequels, Adaptations, Recent
**Clevatess** (full title: *Clevatess: Majū no Ō to Akago to Shikabane no Yūsha* / *The King of Magical Beasts, the Baby, and the Corpse Hero*) is a dark fantasy series by Yūji Iwahara. Below is a detailed breakdown of its current status, adaptations, and ongoing story.

### **1. Sequels, Spinoffs, and Continuity**
As of early 2026, **Clevatess** exists as a standalone series with no direct sequels, prequels, or spinoffs within its specific universe. 
*   **Related Works:** While not in the same continuity, the series is closely associated with the author’s other famous works, **Dimension W** and **King of Thorn**. Fans often compare the world-building and "rough" art style across these titles.
*   **New Edition Continuity:** In July 2024, Kadokawa began publishing a **"New Edition"** of the compiled manga volumes. This version features new cover art and minor touch-ups to the illustrations but maintains the same story continuity as the original 2020 Line Manga release.
*   **Universe Connections:** The series explores a world with "Four Beast Kings" (of which Clevatess is one) and multiple humanoid races. While other Demon Kings like **Zavthier** and **Vorden** appear, they are part of the main series' narrative rather than separate spinoffs.

### **2. Manga vs. Anime: Adaptations and Differences**
The anime adaptation, produced by **Lay-duce**, premiered in July 2025 and concluded its first season in September 2025.
*   **Coverage:** Season 1 consists of 12 episodes, covering the first **24 chapters** of the manga (roughly Volumes 1 through 4).
*   **Visual Style:** The manga is renowned for Yūji Iwahara’s bold ink work and detailed, layered backgrounds. Some fans have noted that the anime, while competent, struggles to replicate the "gritty" and "uncompromising" aesthetic of the original panels, particularly in the more brutal action sequences.
*   **Character Development:** The anime places a slightly stronger emphasis on the "found family" dynamic between Clen (Clevatess's human form), Alicia, and Luna early on. In contrast, the manga maintains a more detached, "scientific observation" tone from Clevatess's perspective for a longer period.
*   **Season 2:** A second season has been officially announced, expected to cover the "Solsein Magic Academy Arc."

### **3. Latest Arc and Current Events (Ongoing Updates)**
The manga is currently in its **Final Arc**, which began in early 2025. As of January 2026, the series has reached **Volume 11** (released October 2025) and is serialized up to **Chapter 58** on digital platforms like WEBTOON.

**Current Plot Developments (Spoilers):**
*   **The Solsein Magic Academy Arc:** Following the defeat of General Drel, Clen and Alicia infiltrate the Solsein Magic Academy to investigate Drel's research into "Arcanacites" and the "Royal Forge." Clen uses his magic to disguise Alicia as a teenager, leading to various comedic and tense situations.
*   **The Summit of Kings:** A major political gathering where the secrets of the "Royal Forge" are exposed. It is revealed that the Forge is a sentient, malevolent force that has been controlling the Hiden royal line for generations.
*   **The Return of the King (Chapter 56+):** Luna (whose true name is revealed as **Toth** or **Hidelius VI**) is at the center of a struggle for the throne. Clen, who initially viewed humanity with nihilistic indifference, has begun to show genuine sympathy and protective instincts toward Luna, effectively becoming his "magic teacher" and protector.
*   **Vorden’s Interference:** Another Demon King, **Vorden**, has appeared in human form, seeking to resurrect a "True Hero" from the ancient past, which threatens to upend the current balance of power between humans and magical beasts.

## Locations, Arcs
*Clevatess: Majū no Ō to Akago to Shikabane no Yūsha* (Clevatess: The King of Magical Beasts, the Baby, and the Corpse Hero) is set on the continent of **Edthea** (also referred to as Esthea), a world where humanity is confined to a central region surrounded by the domains of four god-like Beast Kings.

### **I. World Geography & Important Locations**
The world is structured as a "puppet garden" where humanoid races are kept within specific borders by the **Four Lords of Dark Beasts**.

#### **The Four Domains (Borderlands)**

#### **Major Kingdoms & Regions**
*   **Kingdom of Haiden (Hiden):** The primary setting for the prologue. It was a powerful nation known for its "Forge," the only place capable of crafting weapons for heroes. It was destroyed by Clevatess in a single night.
*   **Kingdom of Boelate:** A militaristic nation that seeks to seize the ruins of Haiden and its magical resources (arcanacites). It is led by the ambitious General Dorel.
*   **Kingdom of Eslinn:** An older, more traditional nation. It is home to the **Salian (Solsein) Magic Academy**, the oldest seminary in the world.
*   **The Plains of Dorne:** A vast battlefield where the "Wizards" (users of dark arts) have recently begun to influence international conflicts.
*   **Shiron Village:** A rural village where the protagonists stay during their early journey; it serves as a backdrop for the "Crows" bandit conflict.

#### **The Five Humanoid Races**
1.  **Hideneans:** The people of Haiden, known for smithing and the royal bloodline of Luna.
2.  **Dornes:** Divided into the nations of **Eslinn** and **Boelate**; they are the most "typical" humans.
3.  **Orggs (Origttes):** Ogre-like humanoids with great physical strength.
4.  **Bents:** A nomadic, "savage" race living in the wastelands.
5.  **Sladians:** An aquatic race that lives in archipelagoes and peninsulas; they are reclusive and skilled in shipbuilding.

#### **1. The Destruction of Haiden Arc**
*   **Events:** 13 heroes attack Clevatess in the South and are slaughtered. Enraged, Clevatess destroys the capital of Haiden. He finds a baby (Luna) and, on a whim, decides to raise it to understand humanity. He revives Alicia as an immortal "corpse hero" to serve as a nanny.

## Power System, Combat
In the dark fantasy world of *Clevatess* (full title: *Clevatess: The King of Magical Beasts, the Baby, and the Corpse Hero*), the power system and combat are defined by a stark divide between the overwhelming, natural-disaster-like power of the Beast Kings and the desperate, tool-assisted struggle of humanity.

### **1. Power System Mechanics**

The power system is "Hard Fantasy," focusing on rare materials, ancient bloodlines, and the absolute authority of the Four Lords of Dark Beasts.

*   **The Four Beast Kings (Lords of Dark Beasts):**
    *   **Mechanics:** They are the ultimate rulers of the world’s borderlands. Their power is elemental and absolute, often described as a force of nature.
    *   **Abilities:** Each king has a unique domain. **Clevatess** (South) controls light and shadow; **Vordein** (North) commands fire, blood, and ancient sorcery; **Zaftier** (West) is a master of illusions; and **Laswell** (East) is a colossal sea-based entity.
    *   **Rules & Limitations:** While nearly omnipotent in their true forms, they can shapeshift into human forms (like Clevatess’s "Clen" form). In these forms, they are significantly physically weaker and more vulnerable, though they retain their vast wisdom and some magic.
*   **Manahydrite & Arcanacites:**
    *   **Manahydrite:** A rare, magical metal that is the only substance capable of harming a Beast King. It is used to tip arrows or forge the "Regalia" swords used by the 13 Heroes.
    *   **Arcanacites:** Powerful crystals or remnants found in the ruins of ancient civilizations (like the Kingdom of Hiden). They serve as a primary energy source for high-level human magic and technology.
*   **The Forge of Hiden:**
    *   A legendary facility used to craft the world's most powerful weapons. It has a "King Revival" mechanic: those who become king are thrown into the forge and revived as a "Forge King." This grants them power but binds them to the forge’s will, preventing them from disobeying its core directives.
*   **The Corpse Hero (Alicia Glenfall):**
    *   **Mechanics:** Alicia was revived by Clevatess using his own demonic blood (ichor).
    *   **Abilities:** She possesses "Water Blade Swordsmanship" and near-immortality. She can survive wounds that would kill any human, but she is technically an "animated corpse."
    *   **Limitations:** She is bound to Clevatess’s magic; she cannot disobey him or die permanently while his magic sustains her. However, Clevatess cannot easily repair "heavily damaged" parts; he must sometimes "patch" her or others with monster parts (e.g., using troll limbs to strengthen a servant).

### **2. Tiers and Progression**

Power is strictly tiered, and "leveling up" is rare and costly.

*   **Tiers:**
    1.  **Calamity/Beast King:** Capable of wiping out entire nations in a single night.
    2.  **Hero/Swordmaster:** The peak of human potential (e.g., Alicia, her father Margot). They can "scratch" a Beast King but cannot defeat one alone.
    3.  **Magic Sword Soldiers:** Elite units using mass-produced magical gear.
    4.  **Hominid Races:** Humans (Dunes/Hideneans), Ogres (Origttes), Sea-folk (Sladians), and Barbarians (Benti).
*   **Progression:** Humans progress through **Soul Absorption** and **Weapon Evolution**. For example, the "Sacred Treasures" (Regalia) can absorb the souls of defeated monsters to gain individuality and limitless strength. General Dorel progressed by absorbing a dragon's soul, which granted him a "third eye" and a transformation that bridged the gap between human and beast.

### **3. Combat and Fighting Style**

Combat in *Clevatess* is a blend of **visceral brutality** and **high-stakes tactics**.

*   **Fighting Style:**
    *   **Alicia:** Her style is practical and rugged. She uses dual-sword techniques (Waterfall Slicer) that emphasize speed and flow. Because she is undead, she often fights with a "suicidal" edge, taking hits that would be fatal to distract or pin down enemies.
    *   **Beast Kings:** Their combat is "spectacle-driven." When Clevatess fights, it isn't a duel; it is an erasure of space using shadows and light.
*   **Tactical Depth:** Battles are won through preparation rather than "shonen power-ups." Humans use shield walls to contain magical blasts and time their volleys of Manahydrite arrows to hit during a monster's recovery frames. The series emphasizes the "cost" of magic—using it often requires specific catalysts or physical tolls.
*   **Flashy Spectacle vs. Emotional Weight:**
    *   **Spectacle:** The art (by Yūji Iwahara of *Dimension W* fame) is highly detailed, featuring massive explosions, crumbling architecture, and "flashy" elemental effects like Dorel’s fire-wreathed slashes.
    *   **Emotional Weight:** Fights are rarely just about winning; they are about the burden of the "Hero" title. Alicia’s battles are often fueled by her trauma of being a "failed hero" and her developing maternal bond with the baby, Luna. The combat often highlights the tragedy of human ambition clashing with the indifference of ancient gods.
