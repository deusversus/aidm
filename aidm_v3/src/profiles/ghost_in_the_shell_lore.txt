## Power System
The "power system" in *Ghost in the Shell* is a grounded, hard-science fiction framework based on the integration of the human consciousness (**Ghost**) with technological interfaces (**Shell**). It is not a magical system but a technological hierarchy defined by cyberization levels, hacking proficiency, and the evolution of artificial intelligence.

### 1. Core Mechanics: The Ghost and the Shell
*   **The Ghost:** The "soul" or essence of an individual. It represents sentience, intuition, and identity. In this universe, a Ghost can exist within a biological brain, a cyberbrain, or even emerge from complex data (as seen with the Puppet Master).
*   **The Shell:** The physical body, whether biological, partially cybernetic, or a "full-body prosthesis." The shell is the hardware that houses the Ghost.
*   **Cyberbrain (Dennō):** A mechanical casing for the brain that allows it to interface directly with networks. It acts as a bridge between the Ghost and the digital world.
*   **Micromachines:** Nanotechnology used to facilitate the connection between organic neurons and cybernetic hardware.

### 2. Abilities and Technology
*   **Thermoptic Camouflage:** An active stealth technology that bends light around the user, making them nearly invisible. It requires significant power and is usually reserved for high-end military or police units like Section 9.
*   **Brain-Diving:** The act of entering another person's cyberbrain or a secure network. This allows for the retrieval of memories, data, or even the direct control of the target.
*   **Sensory Distortion ("Stealing Eyes"):** High-level hackers can intercept and replace a target's visual or auditory data in real-time, making themselves invisible to the victim or altering their perception of reality.
*   **Remote Hacking:** The ability to take control of vehicles, drones, or other people's prosthetic limbs via wireless or wired connections.

### 3. Tiers of Power
Power in this world is categorized by the quality of hardware (Shell) and the skill of the software/user (Hacker).

#### **Cyberization Tiers**
*   **Natural/Minimal:** Individuals like Togusa who have only a cyberbrain for communication. They are less powerful physically but are more resistant to certain types of ghost-hacking because they have more "human" intuition and fewer digital vulnerabilities.
*   **Partial Cyborg:** Individuals like Saito (cybernetic eye/arm) or Ishikawa. They have specialized enhancements for specific roles (sniping, data processing).
*   **Full-Body Prosthesis:** Individuals like Major Kusanagi and Batou. Their entire bodies are mechanical, granting superhuman strength, speed, and durability. They can survive falls from skyscrapers and swap bodies as needed.

#### **Hacker Tiers**
*   **Class-A / Wizard Class:** Elite hackers capable of bypassing standard government firewalls.
*   **Super-Wizard Class:** The highest tier of hacker (e.g., The Laughing Man, The Puppet Master). They can hack dozens of people simultaneously, rewrite memories on the fly, and "disappear" from digital records entirely.

### 4. Rules and Limitations
*   **The "Ghost" Requirement:** You cannot "ghost-hack" a purely mechanical AI that hasn't developed a Ghost, nor can you easily hack a human who has no cyberbrain (though they can still be manipulated via external sensory hacking).
*   **Barrier Mazes & Attack Barriers:** Cybersecurity isn't just passive; "Attack Barriers" can physically "fry" a hacker's brain, causing permanent brain damage or death. "Labyrinth Barriers" trap a hacker's consciousness in an infinite loop of data.
*   **Maintenance & Cost:** Full-body prosthetics are prohibitively expensive and require regular "tuning" and specialized oil. Without maintenance, the synchronization between the Ghost and Shell degrades.
*   **Legal Constraints:** Ghost-hacking is a top-tier felony. Section 9 operates in a legal gray area, but even they are subject to oversight regarding "unauthorized diving."

### 5. Progression and Evolution
*   **Physical Progression:** Characters do not "level up" in a traditional sense; they upgrade their shells. Major Kusanagi frequently switches between different models of the **Megatech Class-A** body depending on the mission (e.g., a high-strength combat body vs. a discreet civilian body).
*   **Sentience Progression:** The most significant "progression" in the series is the evolution of AI.
    *   **Tachikomas:** These spider-tanks begin as standard AI but develop "Ghosts" through curiosity, shared experience, and the accumulation of individual memories (breaking their synchronization).
    *   **The Singularity:** The ultimate progression is the merging of a human Ghost with a sentient AI (The Puppet Master), resulting in a new form of existence that transcends the physical "Shell" and exists entirely within the Net.

## Characters
*Ghost in the Shell* centers on **Public Security Section 9**, an elite intelligence department in a near-future Japan where cybernetics and the "cyberbrain" have blurred the lines between human and machine.

### **The Protagonist: Major Motoko Kusanagi**
*   **Role:** The field commander of Section 9. She is a tactical genius and the team’s primary decision-maker during operations.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Full-Body Prosthesis:** One of the few individuals to have a 100% synthetic body (only her brain and spinal cord remain organic), giving her superhuman strength, speed, and durability.
    *   **Master Hacker:** She is a world-class "net-diver," capable of hacking into cyberbrains and secure networks in real-time.
    *   **Therm-Optic Camouflage:** She frequently uses specialized technology to become nearly invisible.
*   **Philosophy:** Her character arc often revolves around the "Ghost" (soul) and whether a machine-bound consciousness can truly be considered human.

### **Key Antagonists**
The antagonists in *Ghost in the Shell* are rarely "villains" in the traditional sense; they are often catalysts for philosophical or political change.

1.  **The Puppet Master (Project 2501):**
    *   *Iteration:* 1995 Film / Manga.
    *   *Motivation:* An AI created by the government that achieved sentience. It seeks to "evolve" by merging its consciousness with the Major's to create a new, biological-digital lifeform.
2.  **The Laughing Man (Aoi):**
    *   *Iteration:* *Stand Alone Complex* (Season 1).
    *   *Motivation:* A genius hacker who discovered corporate corruption regarding a "miracle cure" for cyberbrain sclerosis. He uses his skills to expose the truth, inadvertently creating a "Stand Alone Complex" (mass imitation without an original).
3.  **Kazundo Gouda:**
    *   *Iteration:* *S.A.C. 2nd GIG*.
    *   *Motivation:* A high-ranking official who manipulates refugee crises and nuclear tensions to force Japan into a new political era. He is a master of psychological manipulation.
4.  **Hideo Kuze:**
    *   *Iteration:* *S.A.C. 2nd GIG*.
    *   *Motivation:* A revolutionary leader for the refugees. He shares a tragic childhood connection with the Major and seeks to upload the "ghosts" of the refugees into the Net to save them from physical war.

---

### **Core Relationships**
*   **The Major & Batou:** They share a deep, unspoken bond of trust. While Batou often shows protective, almost romantic affection for her, the Major views him as her most reliable partner and "anchor" to the physical world.
*   **The Major & Aramaki:** A relationship of mutual respect. Aramaki provides the legal and political "shell" that allows the Major to operate outside the law, while she provides the results he needs to keep Japan safe.
*   **Batou & Togusa:** Often paired together, they represent the "Cyborg vs. Human" dynamic. Batou frequently teases Togusa for his "natural" body and his preference for old-fashioned revolvers, but he deeply respects Togusa’s unique detective's intuition.
*   **The Team & The Tachikomas:** The Section 9 "Think Tanks" (spider-like AI robots) develop their own personalities. The team (especially Batou) treats them like pets or children, leading to a subplot about whether AI can develop its own "Ghost."

## Locations
The *Ghost in the Shell* (GitS) franchise is set in a mid-21st-century "post-cyberpunk" world where geography has been radically reshaped by two major conflicts: **World War III** (a limited nuclear exchange) and **World War IV** (a conventional global conflict).

### **1. Primary Setting: Niihama City (New Port City)**
Most of the series takes place in the fictional metropolis of **Niihama-shi**, also known as **New Port City**.
*   **Geography:** It is located in the fictional **Niihama Prefecture**. While its exact real-world equivalent is debated, it is generally placed in the **Kobe/Osaka** region on the Seto Inland Sea.
*   **Visual Inspiration:** In the 1995 film, director Mamoru Oshii famously modeled the city's "Old Town" after **Hong Kong** (specifically the Kowloon Walled City), featuring narrow, flooded alleys, neon signs in Cantonese, and a sense of "information deluge."
*   **Role:** It serves as the administrative and technological hub of Japan. Following the submersion of much of Tokyo, Niihama became the de facto capital and the base of operations for Public Security Section 9.

### **2. Important Domestic Locations (Japan)**
*   **Section 9 Headquarters:** A top-secret facility in Niihama City. It is often disguised as a front company (like a security firm). It features high-tech labs, a "Think Tank" (Tachikoma) workshop, and a rooftop helipad.
*   **Dejima (Refugee Island):** Featured prominently in *Stand Alone Complex: 2nd GIG*. It is a reclaimed artificial island off the coast of **Kyushu** (near Nagasaki). It serves as a massive, overcrowded camp for "invited refugees" from the Asian mainland.
*   **Fukuoka:** In the *SAC* timeline, the Japanese government and the National Diet (Parliament) are often shown to be located here, as it was less affected by the wars than the Kanto region.
*   **New Tokyo:** Much of the original Tokyo was submerged or destroyed during WWIII. "New Tokyo" refers to the partially rebuilt or remaining districts (like Shinjuku), which often function as refugee zones or high-security government sectors.
*   **Harima City:** An industrial city often mentioned in relation to cybernetic manufacturing and heavy industry.

### **3. Global Geopolitical Geography**
The world is divided into several major power blocs, as the United States collapsed and fractured after the wars:
*   **The American Empire (AE):** Primarily composed of the former Southern and Southwestern United States. It is a hyper-militaristic, imperialist state that maintains a tense security pact with Japan.
*   **The Russo-American Alliance:** A bloc formed by the former Northern U.S. states and Russia. They are the primary rivals to the American Empire.
*   **The United States of America:** A "rump state" consisting of the remaining central and western states, significantly diminished in power.
*   **The European Union (EU):** Remains a stable power, though often depicted as being in a diplomatic tug-of-war between the Japanese and American interests.
*   **The People's Republic of China:** Though fractured by internal conflict and the world wars, it remains a source of many of the refugees (the "Gaku" or Asian refugees) seen in Japan.

### **4. Key Locations in Specific Adaptations**
*   **Etorofu Special Economic Development Zone (*Innocence*):** A lawless, "Northern Frontier" zone (based on the real-world Kuril Islands) where the **Locus Solus** corporation operates its gynoid factory ship in international waters to evade Japanese law.
*   **Palm Springs (*SAC_2045*):** The series begins in a desolate, post-economic-collapse California, where Major Kusanagi and her mercenary group (GHOST) operate in "Sustainable War" zones.
*   **The "Net":** While not a physical location, the Net is treated as a distinct geographical space with its own "topography." Characters "dive" into specific nodes, such as the **Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Data Vault** or the **Puppet Master's** origin points.

### **5. Environmental Geography: The "Japanese Miracle"**
The geography of Japan is unique because of the **Japanese Miracle**—a technology involving radiation-scrubbing micromachines. This allowed Japan to clean up its nuclear fallout faster than any other nation, making it the world's most stable and technologically advanced "oasis," which in turn drives the massive influx of refugees and international espionage seen in the series.

## Combat
Combat in the *Ghost in the Shell* (GitS) franchise is a sophisticated blend of high-tech tactical warfare, visceral martial arts, and existential philosophy. It varies significantly across different media—from the gritty, philosophical 1995 film to the tactical police procedural of *Stand Alone Complex* (SAC) and the high-octane spectacle of *Arise* and *SAC_2045*.

### 1. Combat Fighting Styles
The fighting styles in GitS are defined by the **full-body cyberization** of the protagonists, allowing for movements that would be impossible or lethal for a biological human.

*   **Motoko Kusanagi (The Major):** Her style is a "military-spec" hybrid. It combines high-level striking and grappling with superhuman agility. Because her body is entirely synthetic, she can exert force that would shatter human bones, often seen when she leaps from skyscrapers or pins opponents with crushing strength. In *Arise*, her style is more aggressive and raw, reflecting her younger, less refined self.
*   **Batou:** A "near-combat" specialist, Batou relies on brute strength and heavy ordnance. His style is more "tank-like," absorbing damage while delivering devastating blows. He often uses heavy machine guns or his bare fists to demolish cybernetic opponents.
*   **Saito:** The team’s tactical sniper. His combat is defined by patience and precision, aided by his "Hawkeye" cybernetic eye, which allows him to interface with satellites for perfect targeting.
*   **Melee Weaponry:** While firearms are primary, Section 9 members often use combat knives, stun knuckles, and retractable blades. The Major is also known for using her environment as a weapon, turning everyday objects into lethal tools.

### 2. Tactical Elements
Tactics in *Ghost in the Shell* are often more important than raw power. Battles are frequently won through information warfare rather than just bullets.

*   **Thermoptic Camouflage:** This is the franchise's signature tactical tool. It renders the user nearly invisible by bending light around their body. It is used for stealth insertions, ambushes, and psychological warfare.
*   **Cyberbrain Hacking (Ghost Hacking):** Combat often takes place in the "Net" or through direct neural links. Hackers can "steal eyes" (hijack an enemy's visual feed), plant false memories to confuse targets, or even force an enemy to commit suicide or fire on their own comrades.
*   **Tachikomas / Think Tanks:** These AI-driven walking tanks provide mobile fire support and tactical data. Their ability to climb walls and move with spider-like agility adds a vertical dimension to Section 9’s tactics.
*   **Team Synergy:** Section 9 operates as a cohesive unit. A typical engagement involves Ishikawa providing tech support, Saito providing overwatch, and the Major and Batou leading the ground assault.

### 3. Emotional and Psychological Depth
Combat in GitS is rarely "just a fight"; it is often an extension of the characters' internal struggles.

*   **The "Ghost" vs. The "Shell":** The most famous combat scene—the **Major vs. the Spider Tank** in the 1995 film—is a physical manifestation of her existential crisis. As she literally tears her own body apart to open the tank's hatch, the scene highlights the fragility of her "shell" compared to the resilience of her "ghost" (soul).
*   **The Toll of Hacking:** Ghost hacking is portrayed as a deeply invasive and traumatic act. The emotional weight of a battle often comes from the realization that an enemy's memories or motivations have been fabricated, as seen in the "Garbageman" sequence in the original film.
*   **Sustainable War:** In *SAC_2045*, the concept of "Sustainable War" explores the desensitization of society to conflict, where war becomes a background economic necessity, affecting the emotional state of the soldiers fighting it.

### 4. Flashy Spectacle Battles
While the series is known for its quiet, brooding moments, it features some of the most iconic "spectacle" battles in anime history:

*   **The Water Duel (1995 Film):** A visually stunning fight where the Major uses thermoptic camo to fight a cloaked criminal in a shallow canal. The ripples in the water are the only clue to their positions, creating a high-stakes "invisible" duel.
*   **The Spider Tank Battle (1995 Film):** A brutal, one-sided fight where the Major is outgunned by a massive mecha. It is famous for its visceral detail, showing the mechanical gore of a cyborg body being pushed to its absolute limit.
*   **The Sniper Duel (*Solid State Society*):** A tense, high-stakes battle between Saito and an elite female sniper. It is a masterclass in tactical tension, focusing on wind speed, bullet drop, and the psychological game of "who blinks first."
*   **Highway Posthuman Battle (*SAC_2045*):** Utilizing modern 3D CGI, this battle features high-speed chases and gravity-defying combat against "Posthumans"—beings whose cybernetic evolution makes them faster and more dangerous than even the Major.
*   **Locus Solus Massacre (*Innocence*):** Batou and Togusa storm a corporate headquarters, facing off against waves of security androids in a beautifully animated, hyper-violent sequence that blends classical music with mechanical carnage.

## Tone
*Ghost in the Shell* (GitS) is a landmark cyberpunk franchise that varies significantly in tone and mood across its different iterations. While the 1995 film is famous for its somber philosophy, the original manga is surprisingly comedic, and the television series *Stand Alone Complex* (SAC) finds a middle ground as a political thriller.

### **1. Genre and Mood**
*Ghost in the Shell* is the definitive **Cyberpunk** work, but it often leans into sub-genres depending on the adaptation:
*   **1995 Film:** Philosophical Noir / Meditative Sci-Fi. The mood is **melancholic, cold, and ethereal**.
*   **Stand Alone Complex:** Political Thriller / Police Procedural. The mood is **cerebral, tense, and professional**.
*   **Original Manga:** Satirical Cyberpunk / Action-Comedy. The mood is **energetic, chaotic, and irreverent**.
*   **Arise / SAC_2045:** Action-Espionage. These lean more toward modern military sci-fi with a more "accessible" but sometimes flatter mood.

### **2. Tone and Atmosphere**
The franchise is renowned for its "urban dreamscape" atmosphere.
*   **Atmosphere of the 1995 Film:** Director Mamoru Oshii used slow pacing and "liminal spaces" (empty city streets, rain-soaked alleys) to create a sense of isolation. The atmosphere is **heavy and damp**, heavily inspired by the crowded, decaying architecture of old Hong Kong.
*   **Atmosphere of SAC:** The world feels "lived-in" but cleaner. It focuses on the **bureaucratic and systemic** atmosphere of a high-tech government, where the "ghost" is often lost in a sea of data and red tape.

### **3. Key Themes**
*   **Identity and the "Ghost":** The central question is what constitutes a "soul" (Ghost) when the body (Shell) is entirely synthetic.
*   **Transhumanism:** The series explores the blurring of boundaries between human and machine, suggesting that evolution is no longer biological but technological.
*   **The Stand Alone Complex:** A sociological theme exploring how individuals, without a leader or shared origin, can spontaneously act in a way that mimics a coordinated group (the "copy without an original").
*   **Political Corruption:** Most plots involve Section 9 uncovering conspiracies within the very government they serve, highlighting the friction between individual ethics and state stability.

### **4. Dark Comedy and Humor**
While the 1995 film is almost entirely humorless, other versions utilize **Dark Comedy** to highlight the absurdity of a cyberized world:
*   **The Manga’s "Goofiness":** Masamune Shirow’s original manga features "silly faces," meta-commentary in the margins, and a much more sarcastic Major Kusanagi. She frequently hacks her teammates' cyberbrains to make them do embarrassing things (e.g., making Batou punch himself).
*   **The Tachikomas:** In *SAC*, these sentient "think-tanks" provide dark, existential humor. They discuss high-level philosophy (like the nature of death or God) with the high-pitched voices and curiosity of children, often while casually engaging in lethal combat.
*   **Satire:** The series often satirizes the "planned obsolescence" of the human body, where characters treat losing a limb or a memory like a minor software glitch or a broken phone screen.

### **5. Optimism vs. Pessimism**
Despite its often gritty exterior, *Ghost in the Shell* is frequently interpreted as **optimistic** compared to other cyberpunk works like *Blade Runner* or *Neuromancer*:
*   **Evolutionary Optimism:** Instead of viewing the loss of humanity to machines as a tragedy, the ending of the 1995 film and the manga treats it as a **transcendence**. The Major’s decision to merge with the Puppet Master is a "synthesis"—a Hegelian step forward into a higher state of consciousness.
*   **Competence Porn:** There is an optimistic belief in **professionalism**. Section 9 is a group of highly skilled individuals who, despite the corruption around them, genuinely believe they can make a difference through their "individual talent."
*   **The Future is Not a Dystopia:** Unlike many cyberpunk worlds, the world of GitS is not a total corporate hellscape. It is a functional, albeit complex, society where technology has solved many old-world problems (like disease) even as it creates new ones.

## Arcs, Sequels, Adaptations, Recent, Series Aliases
The *Ghost in the Shell* (GitS) franchise, known in Japan as **Kōkaku Kidōtai** (攻殻機動隊, lit. "Mobile Armored Riot Police"), is a cornerstone of the cyberpunk genre. Created by Masamune Shirow in 1989, it has evolved into multiple distinct timelines and adaptations.

### **1. Major Story Arcs & Timeline Progression**
The franchise is divided into three primary "universes" that do not share the same continuity.

#### **A. The Original Manga Timeline**
*   **The Ghost in the Shell (1989–1991):** Focuses on Major Motoko Kusanagi and Section 9. The central arc is the **Puppet Master Affair**, where a sentient AI (Project 2501) seeks to merge with the Major to achieve biological-like evolution. It ends with the Major leaving Section 9 and merging her "ghost" with the AI.
*   **1.5: Human-Error Processor (1991–1996):** Set after the Major's departure. It follows Section 9 (Batou, Togusa, etc.) solving episodic cybercrimes.
*   **2: Man-Machine Interface (1997):** Set four years after the original. It follows "Motoko Aramaki," a digital entity/isotope of the Major, as she navigates the "Sea of the Net" and corporate conspiracies involving Poseidon Industrial.

#### **B. The Stand Alone Complex (SAC) Timeline**
*   **Season 1: The Laughing Man (2030):** Section 9 investigates a "Super Class A" hacker who exposed a corporate-government conspiracy to suppress a cheap cure for "Cyberbrain Sclerosis" (the Murai Vaccine) in favor of expensive micromachine treatments.
*   **Season 2: 2nd GIG (2032):** Focuses on the **Individual Eleven**, a terrorist group manipulating a refugee crisis. The antagonist, Hideo Kuze, seeks to upload the ghosts of millions of refugees into the Net.
*   **Solid State Society (2034):** A film set after the Major leaves Section 9. It involves the "Solid State System," a massive kidnapping and brainwashing scheme targeting children to solve Japan's aging population crisis.
*   **SAC_2045 (2045):** Set after a "Global Simultaneous Default" that crashed the world economy. The world is in a state of **Sustainable War**. Section 9 reunites to hunt "Post-Humans"—individuals with god-like hacking and physical abilities.

#### **C. The Arise Timeline (Prequel/Reimagining)**
*   **Arise / Alternative Architecture (2027):** A reimagining of Section 9's origin. It shows a younger, more impulsive Major working for the 501 Organization before forming her own team.
*   **The New Movie (2015):** Serves as the finale to the *Arise* arc, involving the assassination of the Prime Minister.

### **3. Current Events & Ongoing Updates (2025–2026)**
*   **New Anime Series (2026):** Studio **Science SARU** (known for *Scott Pilgrim Takes Off* and *Dandadan*) is producing a new series titled ***The Ghost in the Shell***, scheduled for **2026**. It is rumored to be a more faithful adaptation of the original manga's visual style and tone.
*   **Ongoing Manga:** ***The Ghost in the Shell: The Human Algorithm*** is currently ongoing (Volume 5 released in June 2025). It fills the gap between manga volumes 1.5 and 2.0, focusing on Section 9's operations while the Major is missing.
*   **Legacy Edition (Feb 2026):** Kodansha is releasing a "Legacy Edition" box set in February 2026, featuring the original manga in an unedited, uncensored format for the first time in the West.
*   **Recent Films:** *SAC_2045* was compiled into two theatrical films: *Sustainable War* (2021) and *The Last Human* (2023).

---

### **4. Series Aliases & Continuity Guide**
*   **Japanese Title:** *Kōkaku Kidōtai* (攻殻機動隊).
*   **Abbreviations:** **GitS** (General), **SAC** (Stand Alone Complex), **SSS** (Solid State Society), **MMI** (Man-Machine Interface).
*   **Canon Status:** There is no single "canon." Each universe (Manga, 1995 Movie, SAC, Arise) is its own self-contained reality.
*   **Relationship:** The 1995 film is a "distillation" of the manga's main arc. *SAC* is an "alternate sequel" where the Major never met the Puppet Master and stayed with Section 9. *Arise* is a "reboot prequel."

## Factions
The world of *Ghost in the Shell* is a complex geopolitical landscape shaped by two major world wars (WWIII and WWIV), the collapse of traditional superpowers, and the rise of corporate and cyber-terrorist entities.

### **1. Major Japanese Government Organizations**
The series primarily follows **Public Security Section 9**, but they operate within a broader web of competing government agencies.

*   **Public Security Section 9:** An elite, "black ops" counter-terrorism unit under the Ministry of Home Affairs. They specialize in cyber-warfare and high-profile political crimes. Led by **Daisuke Aramaki** and field commander **Motoko Kusanagi**.
*   **Cabinet Intelligence Service (CIS):** A powerful data-manipulation agency. In *SAC 2nd GIG*, its director **Kazundo Gouda** serves as a primary antagonist, using the agency to manipulate public opinion and incite a refugee crisis.
*   **Public Security Section 6:** Under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They focus on international intelligence and reconnaissance. They were the original creators of **Project 2501 (The Puppet Master)** in the 1995 film and manga.
*   **Public Security Section 4 (The Rangers):** A special forces military unit of the JGSDF. **Batou** is a former member. They are often rivals to Section 9 in military-scale operations.
*   **Umibozu:** A highly secretive black-ops unit of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). Known for their white masks and ruthless efficiency, they are often used by corrupt politicians to "liquidate" other government assets, including Section 9.
*   **Section 1 (Special Service Squad):** Handles serious domestic criminal cases (similar to SWAT).
*   **Section 3:** Acts as the Japanese Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

### **2. Global Powers & Alliances**
By the mid-21st century, the world is divided into several major blocs, often referred to as the **G4** in later series like *SAC_2045*.

*   **The American Empire (AE):** Formed from the southern and central states of the former USA (the "Imperial Americana"). It is a right-wing, militaristic state seeking to reclaim its superpower status. It has a complex "Security Pact" with Japan to access the "Japanese Miracle" (radiation-scrubbing nanomachines).
*   **Russo-American Alliance:** A rival successor state to the US, consisting of the northern states, Alaska, and parts of Russia. They are often at odds with the American Empire.
*   **The Great Asian Union (or Asian Union):** A massive geopolitical bloc led by **China**, which has become the world's dominant economic power.
*   **European Union (EU):** A major political entity that maintains a fragile peace but is heavily involved in the "Sustainable War" economy of 2045.

### **3. Corporate Factions**
Corporations in *Ghost in the Shell* often hold as much power as nations, controlling the technology required for human survival.

*   **Poseidon Industrial:** A massive multinational conglomerate and a key link between *Ghost in the Shell* and Masamune Shirow’s other work, *Appleseed*. It eventually evolves into a nation-state.
*   **Kenbishi Heavy Industries:** A primary manufacturer of military hardware, including the multi-ped tanks (Think Tanks) used by Section 9.
*   **Locus Solus:** A robotics company featured in *Innocence*, involved in the illegal "ghost-dubbing" of children into gynoids.
*   **Hanka Precision Instruments:** A major manufacturer of cybernetic parts and AI, often embroiled in ethical scandals regarding "ghost" experimentation.

### **4. Enemies & Terrorist Groups**
*   **The Individual Eleven:** A terrorist group in *SAC 2nd GIG* driven by a "Stand Alone Complex" virus. They advocate for national isolation and the expulsion of refugees.
*   **The Laughing Man (Aoi):** A genius hacker who exposed corporate corruption in the "Serano Genomics" scandal. While an antagonist to the law, his goals were often morally aligned with justice.
*   **Post-Humans:** Introduced in *SAC_2045*, these are individuals whose cyberbrains have evolved into a new, hyper-intelligent state, posing an existential threat to the current world order.
*   **Human Liberation Front / New World Brigade:** Anti-cyberization groups that believe technology is destroying human identity. They often resort to bombing cybernetic facilities.

### **5. Key Geopolitical Events**
*   **The Japanese Miracle:** Following the nuclear fallout of WWIII, Japan developed micro-machines capable of removing radiation from the environment. This technology made Japan an indispensable global economic and political hub.
*   **The Sustainable War (*SAC_2045*):** A global economic model where the G4 nations engage in perpetual, controlled conflict managed by AI to maintain their military-industrial economies.
*   **The Simultaneous Global Default:** A catastrophic economic event in 2044 that erased all paper and electronic currency, leading to the collapse of the global financial system.
