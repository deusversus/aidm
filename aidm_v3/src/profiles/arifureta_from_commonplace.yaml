power_system:
  name: Status Plates and Ancient Magic
  mechanics: A LiteRPG system where Status Plates display numerical stats, levels,
    and Jobs. Users utilize Mana to perform spells, which typically require Incantations
    and Magic Circles. Advanced users can bypass these via Mana Manipulation. The
    system culminates in Ancient Magic, which manipulates fundamental laws, and Concept
    Magic, which overwrites reality based on the user's will.
  limitations: Standard humans are restricted by a Level 100 cap and limited stat
    growth (100-200 range). Most magic requires time-consuming chants and physical
    circles. Bypassing human limits requires extreme measures like consuming monster
    meat and using Ambrosia to survive the resulting mutation.
  tiers:

  - Job Skills (Mid)
