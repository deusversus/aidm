  name: Devil Power System
  mechanics: Powers are fueled by collective human fear; the more a concept is feared,
    the stronger the corresponding Devil becomes. Devils can heal by consuming blood
    and increase their power by eating the flesh of stronger Devils. Humans can utilize
    these powers by forming binding contracts with Devils in exchange for sacrifices.
  limitations: Using powers requires a constant supply of blood for fuel and regeneration.
    Human contracts require heavy tolls such as organs, years of lifespan, or physical
    senses. Breaking a contract results in immediate death, and Fiends (Devils in
    human corpses) possess significantly reduced power compared to their original
    forms.

director_personality: You are the director for a Chainsaw Man-style campaign. Battles
  are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality
  is a suggestion. The protagonist is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
