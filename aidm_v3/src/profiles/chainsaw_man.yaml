  name: Devil Power System
  mechanics: Powers are fueled by collective human fear; the more a concept is feared, the stronger the corresponding Devil becomes. Devils can heal by consuming blood and increase their power by eating the flesh of stronger Devils. Humans can utilize these powers by forming binding contracts with Devils in exchange for sacrifices.
  limitations: Using powers requires a constant supply of blood for fuel and regeneration. Human contracts require heavy tolls such as organs, years of lifespan, or physical senses. Breaking a contract results in immediate death, and Fiends (Devils in human corpses) possess significantly reduced power compared to their original forms.
