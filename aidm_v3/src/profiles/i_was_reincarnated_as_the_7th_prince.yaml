power_system:
  name: Magic & Qi
  mechanics: A hard magic system fueled by Mana (for magic) or Life Force (for 
    Qi). Magic relies on Chanting (Magic Language), Visualization (mental 
    imagery), and Mana Control. Proficiency is boosted by scientific 
    understanding to optimize visualization. Sub-systems include Modern Magic 
    (elements), Ancient Magic (Lost/Djinn), Holy Magic (contracts/rituals), and 
    Blighted (innate abilities). Qi utilizes Breathing Techniques for physical 
    reinforcement and sensory perception.
  limitations: Mana capacity is fixed at birth based on lineage (the 'bucket' 
    size). Standard casting requires time-consuming chants. Double casting is 
    physically impossible for normal humans due to processing limits. Holy Magic
    typically requires elaborate ceremonies. Qi consumes the user's life force.
