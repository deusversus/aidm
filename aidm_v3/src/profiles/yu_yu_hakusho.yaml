power_system:
  name: Spirit Energy (Reiki) and Demon Energy (Youki)
  mechanics: The system relies on the manipulation of internal energy categorized
    into Spirit Energy (human soul energy fueled by emotions), Demon Energy (diverse
    energy allowing elemental manipulation), and Sacred Energy (a high-level Holy
    Aura). Users can shape this energy into physical forms like projectiles or blades,
    utilize the Spirit Wave to turn the body into a catalyst for healing and enhancement,
    or manifest 'Territories' which are rule-based zones that dictate reality within
    a specific range.
  limitations: Abilities are highly dependent on emotional state and killer instinct;
    the Kekkai Barrier prevents high-tier entities from crossing worlds; extreme techniques
    cause physical self-destruction or charred limbs; using Life Energy as a fuel
    source results in permanent aging or death; and Sacred Energy typically requires
    40 years of meditation to unlock.
