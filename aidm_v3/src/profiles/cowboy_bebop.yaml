  name: Grounded Sci-Fi Framework
  mechanics: Abilities are derived from cybernetic enhancements, biological experimentation, nanotechnology, and chemical stimulants like Red Eye. Rare phenomena like immortality result from hyperspace energy exposure during the Astral Gate Disaster.
  limitations: All enhancements have physical or scientific costs. Combat drugs cause extreme strain and fatal withdrawal, while cybernetics are limited by hardware durability and physical laws.
  tiers:
  - 'Tier 1 (Augmented): Mad Pierrot, Red Eye users'
  - 'Tier 2 (Peak Human): Spike Spiegel, Vicious, Vincent Volaju'
  - 'Tier 3 (Professional): Jet Black, Faye Valentine, ISSP officers'
