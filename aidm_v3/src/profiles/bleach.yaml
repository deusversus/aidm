power_system:
  name: Reiryoku and Reiatsu
  mechanics: 'The system is based on Reiryoku (potential spiritual energy), Reiatsu
    (the physical force exerted when energy is released), and Reishi (spirit particles
    that form the matter of spiritual dimensions). Battles are often determined by
    the density of Reiatsu, which can negate the special abilities of weaker opponents.
    Different races utilize these energies through specific methods: Shinigami use
    Zanpakuto (Shikai and Bankai) and Kido; Hollows use Cero and Resurrección; Quincies
    manipulate external Reishi from the environment; and Fullbringers manipulate the
    souls of inanimate objects.'
  limitations: The system is governed by the Soul Balance, where erasing souls instead
    of purifying them threatens universal stability. Hybrids risk 'Soul Suicide' due
    to internal instability. Bankai usage causes extreme physical strain and typically
    cannot be repaired if broken. Additionally, Hollow power acts as a biological
    poison to Quincies, who lack natural resistance to it.
