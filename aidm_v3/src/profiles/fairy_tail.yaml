power_system:
  name: Magic
  mechanics: Magic is fueled by Ethernano, invisible particles found in the atmosphere
    and stored within a mage's internal container called the Magic Origin. It is primarily
    divided into Caster Magic (expelled from the body) and Holder Magic (requiring
    external tools). Users can unlock a Second Origin for more power or a Third Origin
    for a temporary peak state. Specialized Slayer Magics allow users to consume their
    respective elements to replenish energy, while alternative systems like Curses
    (powered by negative emotions), Spirit Arts (powered by Spiria), and Alchemy (matter
    transmutation) also exist.
  limitations: Depleting Magic Power leads to physical exhaustion, sickness, or death.
    Dragon Slayers suffer from severe motion sickness and the risk of permanent Dragonification.
    Devil Slayers risk soul-tainting madness. Using Third Origin results in the permanent
    loss of magic. Certain taboo spells require the user's lifespan or the destruction
    of their body as payment.
