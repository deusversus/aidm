power_system:
  name: Ki
  mechanics: Ki is a life force energy composed of Genki (physical vigor), Yuki (courage),
    and Shoki (mind). It is utilized through Ki Control for regulation, Ki Suppression
    to hide presence, and Ki Sensing to gauge opponents. Advanced forms include God
    Ki, Destruction Energy (Hakai), and Spirit Control, which allows for techniques
    like Forced Spirit Fission, cloning, and gigantification. It enables physical
    augmentation, energy projection, and movement techniques like flight and teleportation.
  limitations: The physical body has a natural limit on Ki output; techniques like
    Kaio-Ken that override this cause severe physical damage. High-output transformations
    (e.g., Super Saiyan 3) result in rapid stamina drain. Mastery requires balancing
    emotional volatility with mental calm to prevent energy leakage. Additionally,
    fighters must use Ki Control to condense destructive force into small areas to
    avoid destroying the planets they stand on.
