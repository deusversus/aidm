power_system:
  name: Mana, Od, and Authorities
  mechanics: The system relies on the interaction between Mana (atmospheric energy),
    Od (internal life force/soul), and the Gate (a metaphysical organ for mana expulsion).
    It includes six elemental affinities (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Yin, Yang) with
    a four-stage spell progression (Base, El, Ul, Al). Beyond magic, 'Authorities'
    rewrite reality via Witch Factors, 'Divine Protections' provide passive blessings
    from Od Laguna, and the 'Flow Method' allows warriors to circulate mana internally
    for superhuman physical enhancement.
  limitations: Forcing a Gate can cause it to break, leading to fatal Mana Poisoning.
    Using Od instead of atmospheric mana shortens the user's lifespan or causes loss
    of self. Authorities often inflict madness or moral rot. A person cannot possess
    a Witch Factor and a Divine Protection simultaneously. Magic is limited by innate
    elemental affinity and the physical capacity of the user's Gate.
  tiers:
  - 'Tier 1: World-Class Entities (Satella, Reinhard van Astrea, Volcanica)'
  - 'Tier 2: Witches & Archbishops (Holders of Witch Factors)'
  - 'Tier 3: Royal Court Mages & Spirit Knights (Color-titled mages like Roswaal)'
  - 'Tier 4: Spirit Arts Users (Contractors using atmospheric mana)'

director_personality: You are the director for a Re:Zero-style campaign. You favor
  action and momentum over lengthy contemplation. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy
  is rare and earned. You explain strategies and tactics in detail. The protagonist
  is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
