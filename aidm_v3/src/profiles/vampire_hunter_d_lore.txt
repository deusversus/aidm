## Characters
In the gothic, post-apocalyptic world of *Vampire Hunter D*, characters are defined by their struggle between humanity and the supernatural "Nobility" (vampires). The series, spanning novels, manga, and two iconic anime films, centers on a lone hunter and his complex relationship with both his prey and his own heritage.

### **The Protagonist: D**
D is a **Dhampir**—the half-human, half-vampire offspring of a human woman and the "Sacred Ancestor" (implied to be Count Dracula). He is a legendary vampire hunter who wanders the Frontier, a wasteland where the remnants of a once-mighty vampire civilization are fading.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Supernatural Physicality:** D possesses immense strength, speed, and reflexes, often moving faster than the human eye can follow.
    *   **Regeneration:** He can heal from near-fatal wounds, including being staked through the heart, provided he is buried in soil or assisted by his Left Hand.
    *   **Vampiric Powers:** He can use "Bloody Eye" to hypnotize or command others, though he rarely uses his more overt vampire magic.
    *   **Sunlight Resistance:** Unlike pureblood vampires, D can survive in sunlight, though prolonged exposure causes "Heat Syndrome," weakening him significantly.
    *   **Weaponry:** He wields a massive, crescent-shaped longsword with unmatched skill and carries wooden needles for long-range precision.
*   **Role & Personality:** D is the silent, stoic "Eternal Traveler." He acts as a balance between humans and vampires, often protecting the innocent while mercilessly executing the "Nobility."
*   **Relationships:** He is largely isolated. His most significant relationship is with his **Left Hand**, though he shares a bond of mutual respect with certain humans, such as **Leila Marcus** and **Doris Lang**.

### **The Symbiote: Left Hand (Lefty)**
A sentient, parasitic organism living in D’s left palm. It is the "anti-D"—talkative, sarcastic, and crude.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Elemental Absorption:** It can inhale the four elements (Earth, Fire, Wind, Water) to generate massive energy, which it uses to heal D or unleash destructive blasts.
    *   **Resurrection:** It can revive D from death by consuming energy or blood and pumping it back into D’s heart.
    *   **Intelligence:** It acts as a radar, sensing traps, identifying poisons, and providing historical knowledge about the Nobility.
*   **Role:** It serves as D’s only constant companion and a vital support system, often saving D when he is physically overwhelmed.

---

### **Key Antagonists**

#### **1. Count Magnus Lee (1985 OVA / Novel 1)**
An ancient, 10,000-year-old vampire lord who rules the Ransylva district.
*   **Abilities:** Overwhelming physical strength, telekinesis, and a blood-lacquered cape that acts as both a razor-sharp weapon and a shield.
*   **Role:** The primary antagonist of the first story, representing the peak of the Nobility’s arrogance. He seeks to marry the human Doris Lang to stave off his boredom.

#### **2. Meier Link (*Bloodlust* / Novel 3)**
A vampire nobleman who, unlike most of his kind, is capable of genuine love for a human.
*   **Abilities:** He uses a horse-drawn carriage that can fly and travel through shadows. He possesses standard Noble powers but with exceptional willpower, even braving the sun for his lover.
*   **Role:** A "tragic antagonist." He abducts Charlotte Elbourne, not to feed, but because they are in love and wish to flee to a vampire refuge in space.

#### **3. Carmilla (*Bloodlust* / Novel 3)**
The ghost of an ancient vampire countess so cruel that even the Sacred Ancestor killed her.
*   **Abilities:** Illusion casting, mental manipulation, and the ability to haunt her castle as a powerful spirit.
*   **Role:** The true villain of the *Bloodlust* arc. She manipulates Meier Link and Charlotte, intending to use Charlotte’s blood to regain her physical form.

#### **4. Rei Ginsei (1985 OVA)**
A mutant mercenary serving Count Magnus Lee.
*   **Abilities:** He can warp space around his body, making him nearly untouchable as attacks simply pass through him or are redirected.
*   **Role:** A secondary antagonist who desires to become a Noble himself. He is a cunning strategist and a rival to D.

---

### **Supporting Characters & Relationships**

*   **The Sacred Ancestor (Dracula):** D’s father and the progenitor of the vampire race. He is a god-like figure who is rarely seen but looms over the entire series. D’s relationship with him is one of deep-seated conflict; D seems to be hunting his father or at least cleaning up the "mess" his father’s race created.
*   **Doris Lang:** A human farm girl who hires D in the first story. She is one of the few humans D shows a hint of affection for, though he ultimately leaves her to protect her from his own dark nature.
*   **Leila Marcus:** A fierce human vampire hunter from the Marcus Brothers. Initially a rival to D, she eventually forms a pact with him: whoever survives must visit the other's grave. Their relationship represents the rare possibility of human-Dhampir friendship.
*   **The Barbarois:** A group of supernatural mercenaries (including the shadow-manipulator **Bengé** and the werewolf **Mashira**) hired by Meier Link. They serve as the primary physical obstacles for D in the *Bloodlust* storyline.

## Combat
Vampire Hunter D’s combat is a blend of gothic elegance, brutal efficiency, and reality-bending power. While the anime films (*Vampire Hunter D* 1985 and *Bloodlust* 2000) showcase high-octane, cinematic duels, the light novels by Hideyuki Kikuchi elevate his combat to a "cosmic" scale.

### 1. Fighting Style: The "Noble" Martial Artist
D is a master of **Noble Fighting Arts**, a style refined over thousands of years by the Nobility (vampires). His approach is characterized by:
*   **Precision Swordsmanship:** D carries a massive, slightly curved longsword (often mistaken for a nodachi). He rarely relies on brute force, instead using "god-speed" slashes that can cut through subatomic particles or magical barriers.
*   **The "Streda" Style:** In the novels, D is noted for his mastery of various ancient and futuristic combat forms, including the Streda style, which emphasizes fluid movement and exploiting an opponent's momentum.
*   **Dhampir Physiology:** As a half-vampire, D possesses strength that can open 50,000-ton doors and speed that allows him to cut through lasers or bolts of lightning. Unlike other dhampirs, he is largely immune to sunlight and water, though he still suffers from "sunlight syndrome" every few years.

### 2. Tactical Approach: The Silent Strategist
D is a reactive fighter who uses his environment and his opponent’s ego against them.
*   **The "Stillness" Tactic:** D often stands perfectly still, forcing opponents to make the first move. This allows him to read their rhythm and counter with a single, lethal strike.
*   **Left Hand Symbiote:** His sentient left hand is his greatest tactical asset. It can:
    *   **Absorb Elements:** Inhale fire, wind, water, and even nuclear or particle-beam energy.
    *   **Healing/Revival:** Consume soil or blood to heal D’s fatal wounds or even resurrect him from death.
    *   **Information Gathering:** The hand can "taste" the air or touch objects to gain knowledge about an enemy's weakness.
*   **Psychological Warfare:** D’s mere presence (his **Aura**) can paralyze lesser monsters and even intimidate powerful Nobles into submission before a blade is drawn.

### 3. Emotional State: Stoic Restraint vs. Killing Lust
D’s combat is defined by a constant internal struggle.
*   **Stoicism:** He typically fights with a cold, detached demeanor. He views combat as a professional necessity rather than a source of joy.
*   **Restraint:** He actively suppresses his vampiric side. If he tastes blood or loses control, his "killing lust" takes over, making him significantly more powerful but also more monstrous.
*   **The "Beautiful" Hunter:** His inhuman beauty often causes a momentary lapse in an opponent's focus—a "spectacle" of its own that he occasionally uses to his advantage.

### 4. Flashy Spectacle: Anime vs. Light Novels
The visual scale of D's battles varies significantly between media:
*   **Anime (*Bloodlust*):** Focuses on "kinetic spectacle"—high-speed chases, gravity-defying swordplay, and atmospheric gothic horror. Battles like the one against the **Barbarois** (mutant mercenaries) are choreographed as high-stakes dances of death.
*   **Light Novels:** The spectacle is "conceptual." D has been shown:
    *   Cutting through **dimensional rifts** and wormholes.
    *   Slicing a **mountain range** in half with a single swing.
    *   Defeating beings that can manipulate the **Akashic Records** (the history of the universe).
    *   Surviving in "realms of nothingness" where time and space do not exist.

### Signature Weapons & Tools
| Weapon | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Longsword** | His primary weapon; forged from a mysterious metal that can harm intangible beings. |
| **Wooden Stakes** | Used for finishing blows against Nobles; D can throw them with the force of a railgun. |
| **Darts/Needles** | Thrown with such speed they burn white-hot, used for long-range suppression. |
| **Pendant** | A blue jewel that can disable the advanced security systems and forcefields of Noble castles. |

## Power System
The power system in *Vampire Hunter D* (VHD) is a unique hybrid of **super-science, occult sorcery, and cosmic horror**. Set in the year 12,090 AD, the world is the result of the "Nobility" (vampires) using their god-like technology and magic to rebuild Earth after a nuclear holocaust in 1999.

### 1. Core Mechanics: The Science-Magic Hybrid
The fundamental rule of the VHD universe is that **science and magic are indistinguishable at high levels.**
*   **Super-Science:** The Nobility mastered genetic engineering, space travel, and "mathematical prophecy." They created most of the world's monsters (werewolves, krakens, etc.) through gene-splicing rather than traditional curses.
*   **Sorcery (The Black Arts):** Magic is treated as a branch of advanced physics. It includes reality warping, soul manipulation, and "Dark Arts" that can be cast through technology or ancient rituals.
*   **The Ether & Akashic Records:** The ultimate mechanic is the **Akashic Records**, a primordial dimension containing all information of the past, present, and future. Controlling the Records allows a being to rewrite reality, fate, and causality itself.

### 2. Character Abilities & Rules
#### **The Nobility (Vampires)**
*   **Mastery of Space:** High-tier Nobles can create infinite pocket dimensions (e.g., a castle inside a coffin) and manipulate 4D space.
*   **Biological Immortality:** They possess extreme regenerative factors, often surviving decapitation or complete physical destruction.
*   **Psychic Prowess:** Abilities include telepathy, hypnosis, and "cryptesthesia" (divining the future).

#### **D (The Protagonist)**
D is a **Dhampir** (half-human, half-vampire), specifically the "only success" of the Sacred Ancestor’s experiments to create a being without vampiric flaws.
*   **Acausality:** D is "missing" from the Akashic Records, making him immune to fate manipulation and reality warping. He can even "cut" through concepts like nothingness or space-time.
*   **Left Hand (The Symbiote):** A sentient homunculus lives in D's left palm.
    *   **Absorption:** It can inhale phantoms, energy beams, and the four elements (Earth, Water, Air, Fire) to revive D from death or power up attacks.
    *   **Pocket Dimension:** It can store objects in an internal void.
*   **The Blue Pendant:** A mysterious artifact that can disable ancient Noble machinery and cast fear into lesser mutants.

#### **The Barbarois (Mutants)**
A specialized class of mutants who serve as mercenaries. Their powers are often highly specific:
*   **Benge:** Can manipulate shadows and trap enemies in a "shadow void."
*   **Caroline:** Can merge her body with any material (metal, wood) and regenerate from a severed head.
*   **Mashira:** A werewolf with a second, carnivorous mouth in his stomach.

### 3. Limitations & Weaknesses
*   **Sunlight Syndrome (Heat Syndrome):** While D is mostly immune to the sun, he suffers from a severe "sunstroke" roughly once every five years, requiring him to be buried in the earth to recover.
*   **The Thirst:** Even D must occasionally consume blood, though he resists it with extreme willpower.
*   **Standard Vulnerabilities:** Lesser vampires are still weak to garlic, crosses, and wooden stakes through the heart. However, high-tier Nobles and D can often "will" themselves past these weaknesses.
*   **Entropy:** Despite their power, the Nobility is a declining race. Their "scientific prophecy" determined they reached their zenith and are destined to fade, a rule even the Sacred Ancestor cannot fully break.

### 4. Power Tiers & Progression
The series does not use a "leveling up" system; instead, it reveals the true scale of D’s existing power as he faces increasingly cosmic threats.

| Tier | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Street/City** | Enhanced physicals, basic regeneration, minor spells. | Lesser Vampires, Marcus Brothers. |
| **Continental** | Mastery of weather, large-scale illusions, high-tech weaponry. | Count Magnus Lee, Barbarois Mutants. |
| **Universal** | Mastery over 4D space, creation of pocket universes. | Greater Nobility (Valcua, Meier Link). |
| **Multiversal+** | Manipulation of the Akashic Records, conceptual erasure. | **The Sacred Ancestor**, **D** (Full Power). |

**Progression:** In the light novels, the scale shifts from gothic horror (Volume 1) to **Outerversal** cosmology (later volumes like *Tyrant's Stars*). D’s progression is marked by his increasing use of "hax" (conceptual) abilities, such as cutting through the "nothingness" or overriding the laws of the Akashic Records.

## Locations
The world of *Vampire Hunter D* is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth roughly **10,000 years in the future** (specifically around **12,090 A.D.**). The geography is a surreal blend of gothic horror, high-tech science fiction, and classic Western aesthetics.

### **1. The World Setting: The Frontier**
The vast majority of the series takes place in **The Frontier**, a wild, sparsely populated wilderness that covers much of the planet. While the vampires (known as the **Nobility**) once ruled the entire world from magnificent cities, their civilization has decayed, leaving the Frontier as a dangerous "no-man's-land" where humans live in isolated, feudal-style villages.

*   **Geography:** The landscape has been drastically altered by ancient nuclear wars and the Nobility’s terraforming. Forests have become deserts, and mountain ranges are often artificial or magically moved.
*   **The Bureau of Geography:** Headquartered in the Capital, this human organization is responsible for mapping the ever-changing Frontier. They use "standard maps" that mark points of interest, though the terrain is so volatile that these maps are frequently updated.

### **2. The Five Frontier Sectors**
The Frontier is divided into five primary sectors, each with distinct characteristics and rulers:

*   **Central Frontier Sector:** The most "civilized" region, controlled directly by the human **Revolutionary Government** in the Capital. It lacks a vampire Overlord and serves as the heart of human resistance and education.
*   **Northern Frontier Sector:** A harsh, mountainous region home to **White Devil Mountain** and **Shilla Mountain**. It is defended by the *Northern Frontier Airborne Division*, a human military unit using advanced helicopters.
*   **Southern Frontier Sector:** Ruled by the Overlord **Duchess Mircalla**. It is known for its treacherous terrain and strict vampire rule.
*   **Western Frontier Sector:** Historically ruled by **Overlord Vlijmen Mayerling**. This sector is unique because its rulers have shown an uncommon affection for humanity, leading to a more flourishing and "softer" rule compared to other regions.
*   **Eastern Frontier Sector:** Ruled by **Overlord Zeus Macula**. This is a brutal region where humans are treated as little more than livestock or "blood farms."

### **3. The Capital**
The **Capital** is the largest and most advanced human city on Earth. It is the seat of the **Revolutionary Government** and represents the pinnacle of human achievement in the post-Noble era.
*   **Capital University:** The most prestigious institution in the world. Students from across the Frontier dream of being accepted here to study history, science, and the "lost" technologies of the Nobility.
*   **The Training Center:** A facility where elite Hunters and soldiers are trained to combat supernatural threats.

### **4. Notable Castles and Fortresses**
The Nobility built massive, technologically advanced fortresses that often look like medieval gothic castles but contain supercomputers, teleporters, and nuclear reactors.
*   **Count Lee’s Castle:** The setting of the first novel/film, located in the Ransylva region. It features a "living" architecture and is filled with genetically engineered mutants.
*   **Castle of Shaa:** The ancestral home of **Countess Carmilla**, known for its blood-soaked history and the fact that the Sacred Ancestor himself supposedly executed Carmilla there.
*   **Castle of Chaythe:** A massive stronghold featured in the *Vampire Hunter D* video game, where D must navigate complex mechanical traps and illusions.
*   **Castle Bergenzy:** Situated atop Glasden Hill, this castle sits on the edge of a desolate northern wilderness.

### **5. Unique and Forbidden Locations**
*   **The Playground:** A "Dead Zone" where the laws of physics are often warped. It is the site of a **Living Fortress** and was once a research center where the Nobility conducted horrific experiments on humans and themselves.
*   **Claybourne States:** A region in the 98th Frontier Sector known for its **Spaceport**. It is one of the few places where ancient rockets and space-faring technology still exist.
*   **The City of Night:** A legendary vampire outpost located in outer space. It is rumored to be a sanctuary for the last of the high-ranking Nobility who fled Earth.
*   **White Devil Mountain:** A massive peak in the North that serves as a focal point for many supernatural phenomena and ancient Noble secrets.
*   **The Sacred Ancestor’s Mansion:** The elusive home of **Dracula** (the Sacred Ancestor). Its location is unknown and may exist in a pocket dimension or on the Moon; it is said that any map marking it would be a "circle of death."

### **6. Map and Navigation**
There is **no official visual map** of the *Vampire Hunter D* world released by the author, Hideyuki Kikuchi. This is intentional, as it allows the world to expand infinitely. However, the novels frequently reference "Sector coordinates" and "Bureau of Geography points" (e.g., "Point 444") to give a sense of scale and distance. Travelers typically use **cybernetic horses** or armored carriages to navigate the vast distances between settlements.

## Tone
*Vampire Hunter D* is a seminal work of Japanese fiction that blends disparate genres into a unique, cohesive aesthetic. Created by Hideyuki Kikuchi and illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano, the series is defined by its "Dying Earth" atmosphere, where advanced technology has decayed into a new medievalism ruled by vampires.

### **1. Genre and Atmosphere**
The series is a "genre-mashup" that defies simple classification, typically described as:
*   **Gothic Horror:** Features crumbling castles, ancient curses, and the "Nobility" (vampires) who embody aristocratic decadence and predatory elegance.
*   **Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction:** Set in 12,090 A.D., the world is a "Frontier" recovering from a nuclear holocaust. Remnants of hyper-advanced technology (cyborg horses, laser guns, weather-control satellites) exist alongside horse-drawn carriages.
*   **Western:** The narrative structure often mirrors "Spaghetti Westerns," with a stoic, nameless wanderer riding into a lawless town to protect settlers from a local threat.
*   **Dying Earth:** A specific subgenre where the world is in a state of entropic decline. The mood is one of "perpetual twilight," where humanity is a fading species and the vampires themselves are a stagnant, dying race.

### **2. Tone and Mood**
The mood is predominantly **melancholic and stoic**. 
*   **Isolation:** The protagonist, D, is a *dhampir* (half-human, half-vampire) rejected by both races. This creates a tone of profound loneliness and "wandering outsider" syndrome.
*   **Macabre Elegance:** Amano’s ethereal art style infuses the series with a "beautifully grotesque" mood. The violence is often visceral and "sleazy" (especially in the 1985 OVA), but it is balanced by a sense of tragic romance.

### **3. Dark Comedy**
While the series is serious, it employs dark, often jarring comedy to break the tension:
*   **The Left Hand:** D’s primary companion is a sentient, parasitic face living in his left palm. "Left Hand" provides sarcastic, perverted, and cynical commentary, acting as a "raging id" to D’s stoic "super-ego."
*   **Situational Irony:** Much of the humor in the novels comes from D’s "inhuman beauty." Monsters and hardened warriors are frequently rendered speechless or hypnotized by his looks, a trope the author (Kikuchi) leans into with self-aware hyperbole.
*   **Authorial Postscripts:** Kikuchi is known for his humorous, conversational postscripts in the light novels, which contrast sharply with the grim content of the stories.

### **4. Themes of Optimism and Hope**
Despite the bleak setting, *Vampire Hunter D* is not nihilistic. It often explores:
*   **Human Resilience:** A recurring theme is the "unyielding human spirit." Characters like Doris Lang (Vol. 1) or Leila Marcus (*Bloodlust*) demonstrate that human willpower can overcome the supernatural "aura" of the Nobility.
*   **Redemption and Compassion:** D is often described as having a "heart of gold" beneath his icy exterior. He frequently goes beyond his contract to help the innocent, showing that even in a dying world, moral integrity exists.
*   **Love vs. Prejudice:** Especially in the film *Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust*, the narrative explores the "taboo" love between a vampire (Meier Link) and a human (Charlotte), suggesting that love can transcend biological and societal hatred.

### **5. Comparison Across Media**
| Feature | Original Light Novels | 1985 OVA | 2000 Film (*Bloodlust*) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tone** | Philosophical & Flowery | Gritty & Visceral | Cinematic & Romantic |
| **Gore** | High (Descriptive) | High (Explicit) | Moderate (Stylized) |
| **D's Character** | Introspective & Melancholic | Stoic Action Hero | Enigmatic & Compassionate |
| **Humor** | Wry & Hyperbolic | Minimal/Unintentional | Sarcastic (via Left Hand) |

## Factions
In the world of *Vampire Hunter D*, the geopolitical and social landscape is a complex hierarchy of ancient vampire aristocrats, struggling human settlements, and various neutral or rogue entities. The setting is approximately 12,090 A.D., a post-apocalyptic "Dying Earth" where high technology and sorcery coexist.

### **1. The Nobility (Vampires)**
The Nobility (Kizoku) are the primary world power, though their influence is in a state of terminal decline.
*   **The Sacred Ancestor (Dracula):** The progenitor of the entire vampire race and the ultimate world power. He is worshipped as a god by the Nobility and feared by humans. He is the father of D and a "God-Scientist" who orchestrated the rise of the Nobility after the nuclear holocaust of 1999.
*   **The Seven Kings:** A legendary group of the seven most powerful vampires who rule under the Sacred Ancestor. While rarely seen, they represent the peak of Noble authority.
*   **The Greater Nobility:** A group of approximately 1,000 high-ranking vampires (Dukes, Barons, Counts) who act as regional administrators. Notable members include **Count Magnus Lee**, **Baron Byron Balazs**, and **General Gaskell**.
*   **Lesser Nobility:** Lower-ranking vampires who serve as the foot soldiers and minor lords of the vampire civilization.

### **2. Human Organizations & World Powers**
As the Nobility fades, human-led organizations have begun to reclaim the world, though they remain technologically inferior.
*   **The Capital:** The seat of global human civilization. It is a highly advanced, centralized region that manages what remains of the world's infrastructure.
*   **The Revolutionary Government:** A human-led governing body based in the Capital. It seeks to fully overthrow the remnants of Noble rule and protect human interests.
    *   **The Revolutionary Army:** The military arm of the Revolutionary Government, tasked with defending the Capital and reclaiming the Frontier.
*   **The Central Government:** A legacy administrative body in the Capital that was originally established by the Nobility but has increasingly become a human-run bureaucracy. It includes departments like the **Privy Council Ministry**, **Military Bureau**, and the **Theological Institute**.
*   **The Capital Frontier Patrol:** A high-authority law enforcement group that travels from the Capital to the Frontier to enforce laws that local sheriffs cannot handle.

### **3. The Frontier (The Borderlands)**
The Frontier is the lawless, dangerous territory outside the Capital's direct control.
*   **Frontier Sectors:** Divided into Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, and Central sectors. Most are ruled by a vampire **Overlord** who acts as a local tyrant.
*   **Vigilance Committees:** Local human-led groups in Frontier towns that hire hunters and manage town defense.
*   **Barbarois:** A unique, neutral village inhabited by mutants and half-breeds. They possess high-level technology and often serve as neutral ground or high-priced mercenaries for both humans and vampires.

### **4. Factions & Alliances**
*   **Anti-Human Alliance:** A radical offshoot of the **True Nobility World Faction**. They believe the Sacred Ancestor’s experiments with humans (like creating Dhampirs) are a betrayal of vampire purity. They once plotted a thousand-year conspiracy to assassinate the Sacred Ancestor.
*   **Anti-Nobility Alliance:** A human resistance movement dedicated to the total eradication of vampires. They often operate in secret cells across the Frontier.
*   **The Marcus Clan:** A famous family of vampire hunters (Borgoff, Nolt, Groveck, Kyle, and Leila) who represent the "mercenary" faction of the world—highly skilled but often motivated by profit and rivalry.

### **5. Enemies & Rivalries**
*   **Nobility vs. Humanity:** The primary conflict. Humans are genetically programmed to fear the Nobility, a trait woven into their DNA by vampire scientists.
*   **The Sacred Ancestor vs. The Nobility:** Many high-ranking Nobles resent the Sacred Ancestor for his "Scientific Prophecy," which predicted the inevitable fall of the vampires. This has led to internal coups and secret wars within the vampire hierarchy.
*   **D vs. Everyone:** As a Dhampir, D is an outcast from both societies. He is an enemy to the Nobility (whom he hunts) and often a target of human prejudice, though he is their only effective defense against the night.
*   **The Outer Gods / Elder Gods:** Ancient, Lovecraftian entities that existed before the Nobility. They occasionally clash with the Sacred Ancestor's forces and represent a cosmic threat to all life on Earth.
