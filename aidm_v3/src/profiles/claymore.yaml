power_system:
  name: Yoki
  mechanics: Power is derived from Yoma flesh implanted in warriors, allowing them
    to release demon energy in stages (10%, 30%, 50%, 80%) to enhance physical attributes.
    Warriors are categorized as Offensive types, who focus on power, or Defensive
    types, who possess superior regeneration. Advanced users can suppress Yoki entirely
    or use Soul Links to manage the mental strain of transformation.
  limitations: Releasing Yoki carries the risk of reaching the 'Point of No Return'
    at 80%, where predatory instincts overwhelm the human mind. Reaching 100% results
    in permanent 'Awakening' into a monster. Offensive types cannot regrow limbs to
    their original strength, and using Yoki makes warriors detectable to others with
    Yoki-sensing abilities.
