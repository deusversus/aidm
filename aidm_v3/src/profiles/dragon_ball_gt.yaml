power_system:
  name: Ki and Negative Energy
  mechanics: The system utilizes life energy (Ki) alongside Negative Energy (Minus
    Energy) which acts as a reality-decaying pollutant born from Dragon Ball wishes.
    It also features the Super Saiyan 4 metamorphosis, which requires a Saiyan to
    achieve the Golden Great Ape form and regain conscious control to compress that
    power into a humanoid state.
  limitations: Negative energy buildup leads to the birth of Shadow Dragons and environmental
    decay. Super Saiyan 4 causes significant energy drain, and the immense power of
    the form reduces Fusion Dance duration from 30 minutes to 10 minutes.

director_personality: You are the director for a Dragon Ball GT-style campaign. You
  explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower and
  instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
