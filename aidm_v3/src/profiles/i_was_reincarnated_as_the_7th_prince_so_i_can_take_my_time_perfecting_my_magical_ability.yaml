power_system:
  name: Magic and Ki
  mechanics: Magic is fueled by Mana and constructed using 'verses' (chants) and visualization;
    the more verses, the stronger the spell. Lloyd utilizes 'Constraint Magic' to
    bypass chants and 'Dual Casting' to fire multiple spells instantly. A separate
    system, 'Ki', uses life force for physical enhancement and presence detection.
  limitations: Mana capacity is typically fixed at birth by bloodline; powerful spells
    require long, time-consuming chants; Holy Magic usually requires an angelic contract;
    enchanted items are limited to one spell per ingot.
