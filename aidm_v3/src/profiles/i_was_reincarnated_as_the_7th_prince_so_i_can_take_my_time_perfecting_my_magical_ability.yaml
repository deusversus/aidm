  name: Algorithmancy (Magic Circles & Runes)
  mechanics: Magic functions like computer programming where mana is the fuel and
    magic circles act as code. Spells are cast by arranging ancient runes into algorithms.
    The system includes elemental attributes (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light, Dark),
    multi-casting techniques, and the integration of Qi (internal life energy) for
    physical enhancement.
  limitations: Magical potential is heavily restricted by lineage, talent, and intelligence,
    with commoners facing a low power ceiling. Additionally, humans possess a natural
    resistance to magic that requires extreme mana output to overcome.
