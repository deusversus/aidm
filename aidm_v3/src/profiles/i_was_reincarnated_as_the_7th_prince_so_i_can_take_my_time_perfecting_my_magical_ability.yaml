power_system:
  name: Magic
  mechanics: 'Magic is treated as a highly technical science governed by three pillars:
    Bloodline (genetic mana capacity and affinity), Aptitude (intuition for mana manipulation),
    and Effort (academic study). Casters use Mana (Maryoku) to form geometric Spell
    Circles and recite chants to dictate spell effects. The system also encompasses
    alternate disciplines like Qi (life force/breathing techniques) and Divine Sorcery
    (faith/holy magic), which advanced users can weave together.'
  limitations: A caster's potential is strictly limited by their genetic bloodline,
    which sets a hard ceiling on mana capacity. In combat, users are restricted by
    their physical bodies, mana exhaustion, and the time required to draw spell circles
    and recite chants.
