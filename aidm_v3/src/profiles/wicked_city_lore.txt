## Power System, Combat
The **Wicked City** (*Yōjū Toshi*) franchise, created by Hideyuki Kikuchi, features a dark, visceral power system rooted in psychic energy and body horror. The world is defined by a secret conflict between the Human World and the Black World (a parallel demon dimension), policed by an elite force known as the **Black Guard**.

### **1. Power System: Psychic Powers (PP)**
The power system is primarily based on **Psychic Powers (PP)**, a quantified energy source utilized by both high-level humans and demons.

*   **Mechanics & Rules:**
    *   **Quantification:** In the original novels, PP is often referenced with specific numeric values (e.g., a character might have a PP of 5,000). This acts as a measure of their spiritual "battery" and the intensity of the effects they can produce.
    *   **Spiritual Barriers:** A core defensive mechanic. Black Guard agents and spiritual hospitals use barriers to repel demons. These barriers can be "locked" or "broken" depending on the relative PP of the attacker and defender.
    *   **Matter Restructuring:** The protagonist, Taki Renzaburo, possesses the rare ability to restructure matter at the molecular level. He uses this to enhance his physical strikes or manipulate objects, though it is taxing on his human body.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Physical Toll:** Human Black Guard agents are "Badass Normals" enhanced by psychic training. Overusing PP or firing high-caliber anti-demon weapons causes severe internal damage and physical exhaustion.
    *   **Environmental Sensitivity:** Demons are weakened by "holy" or high-frequency spiritual zones, often forcing them to use human disguises to navigate the human world.
*   **Tiers & Progression:**
    *   **Agent Ranks:** While not strictly tiered like modern shonen, there is a clear hierarchy. "Legendary" agents like **Miyuki** (introduced in Novel 2) represent the peak of human capability.
    *   **Demon Evolution:** Demons can "evolve" or strengthen by absorbing others or through unique biological events.
    *   **The Hybrid Boost:** A unique progression mechanic occurs when Makie (a demon) becomes pregnant with Taki’s child. This "hybrid pregnancy" causes her PP to skyrocket, allowing her to manipulate space-time and teleport, as she now embodies the power of both worlds.

### **2. Combat: Style and Spectacle**
Combat in *Wicked City* is a blend of **noir gunplay, body horror, and high-stakes supernatural duels.**

*   **Fighting Style:**
    *   **Visceral Body Horror:** Battles are rarely clean. Demons transform into grotesque, Lovecraftian forms mid-fight (e.g., the "Spider Woman" or "Vagina Dentata" demons). Combat often involves tentacles, acidic fluids, and rapid regeneration.
    *   **Tactical Noir:** Taki fights like a hard-boiled detective. He uses a "Hand Cannon"—a massive anti-demon revolver with recoil so powerful it can throw him through walls. He must use his environment and matter-restructuring to survive against physically superior foes.
    *   **Psychic Finesse:** Makie’s style is more fluid, utilizing psychic "nails" (energy projectiles), healing, and illusions to support Taki.

*   **Tactical vs. Flashy Spectacle:**
    *   **Tactics:** Battles often hinge on finding a demon's "core" or weakness. For example, Taki must wait for a hardened demon to open its mouth to fire a killing shot, or use spiritual barriers to trap a shape-shifter.
    *   **Spectacle:** Directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri in the anime, the battles are famous for their "neon-noir" aesthetic—heavy shadows, bright psychic flashes (like Mayart’s lightning), and fluid, gory animation. The spectacle is defined by the "unfolding" of the human body into something monstrous.

*   **Emotional Weight:**
    *   The battles are deeply tied to the **emotional bond** between Taki and Makie. Initially cynical partners, their combat synergy grows as they fall in love.
    *   **The Stake of the Future:** By the third novel (*The Scarlet Clan*), the combat shifts from simple "police work" to a desperate struggle to protect their unborn child, who represents the only hope for a permanent peace treaty between the two worlds. This adds a layer of "parental desperation" to the flashy spectacle.

## Factions, Locations, Arcs, Sequels, Adaptations, Recent, Series Aliases
**Wicked City** (Japanese: *Yōjū Toshi*, lit. "Supernatural Beast City") is a seminal dark fantasy/horror series created by **Hideyuki Kikuchi**, the renowned author of *Vampire Hunter D*. Originally a light novel series, it gained worldwide cult status through its 1987 anime adaptation.

### **1. Factions, Organizations, and World Powers**
The world of *Wicked City* is defined by a secret "Cold War" between two parallel dimensions: the **Human World** and the **Black World** (a demonic realm).
*   **The Black Guard (Yami-Gari):** A secret, elite organization composed of both humans and "peace-seeking" demons. Their mission is to police the boundary between worlds and uphold the centuries-old peace treaty.
*   **The Radicals:** A militant splinter faction of demons from the Black World who believe demons are superior to humans. They seek to sabotage the peace treaty to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth.
*   **The Signatories:** High-level mystics and diplomats from both worlds who possess the spiritual authority to ratify the treaty. The most prominent is **Giuseppe Mayart**, a 200-year-old perverted but powerful sorcerer.

### **2. Important Locations and Setting**
*   **Tokyo (Human World):** The primary setting, specifically the districts of **Shibuya** and **Hibiya**. The city is depicted as a neo-noir urban landscape where demons hide in plain sight as humans.
*   **The Black World:** A parallel dimension populated by shape-shifting entities. It is a surreal, nightmarish realm that occasionally bleeds into the human world through "space-time rifts."
*   **Narita Airport:** A key location in the first arc where the initial battle to protect the treaty signatory occurs.
*   **Spiritual Hospitals & Hotels:** Secret locations in Tokyo protected by powerful barriers (Kekkai) where Black Guard agents and diplomats take refuge.

### **3. Major Story Arcs and Plot Progression**
The series follows **Renzaburo Taki** (a human Black Guard) and **Makie** (his demon partner).
*   **The Treaty Renewal Arc (Volume 1 / Anime):** The 500-year peace treaty is up for renewal. Taki and Makie must protect Giuseppe Mayart from Radical assassins. It ends with the revelation that Taki and Makie's union is the key to a new era of peace.
*   **The Other Side & Scarlet Clan (Volumes 2–3):** These arcs expand the lore, introducing more complex demon hierarchies and internal betrayals within the Black Guard.
*   **Wicked City New York (Volume 5):** The conflict moves internationally, showing that the demon infestation and Black Guard operations are global.
*   **Evil Mandala (Volume 12):** The final novel (released in 2016), which serves as the series' conclusion, involving a massive supernatural conspiracy that threatens to collapse both dimensions.

### **4. Sequels, Spinoffs, and Continuity**
*   **Demon City Shinjuku:** Also by Hideyuki Kikuchi, it is often considered a "spiritual successor" or set in a sister universe. While not a direct narrative sequel, they share the same "Demon City" (Makai Toshi) aesthetic and themes.
*   **Yashakiden (The Demon Princess):** A spinoff series set in the same universe as *Demon City Shinjuku*, featuring the character **Mephisto**.
*   **The Wicked City (1992 Live-Action):** A Hong Kong film produced by Tsui Hark. It is a loose adaptation that changes names (demons are called "Rapters") and introduces a drug called "Happiness."

### **5. Manga vs. Anime vs. Novel Differences**
*   **Novels:** Much more detailed and darker than the adaptations. They feature a "terse" writing style and focus heavily on the bureaucratic and "espionage" aspects of the Black Guard.
*   **Anime (1987):** Directed by **Yoshiaki Kawajiri**. It adapts only the first novel (*Black Guard*) and is famous for its "vagina dentata" spider-woman and extreme body horror. It simplifies the plot into a 24-hour survival mission.
*   **Manga:** There have been various short-lived manga adaptations, but they are generally less influential than the novels or the film. They often lean more into the "erotic horror" (ero-guro) elements.

### **6. Latest Events and Current Status**
*   **Series Completion:** The main novel series is **complete**, ending with Volume 12, *Evil Mandala*, in 2016.
*   **Recent Media:** **Discotek Media** released a definitive Blu-ray in 2020 featuring a 4K remaster of the 1987 anime, including both the classic Streamline and Manga UK dubs.
*   **Canon Status:** The 12 novels are the primary canon. The anime is considered a standalone masterpiece, while the live-action film is treated as an alternate-universe reimagining.

## Tone, Characters
*Wicked City* (1987), directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri and based on the novels by Hideyuki Kikuchi, is a landmark of adult anime. It is famous for blending high-octane action with grotesque body horror and a distinct neo-noir aesthetic.

### **Tone, Themes, and Atmosphere**
*   **Genre & Mood:** The film is a hybrid of **dark fantasy, action horror, and neo-noir**. It carries a grim, oppressive mood typical of 1980s "cyberpunk-adjacent" anime, characterized by rain-slicked streets, blue-tinted nightscapes, and a sense of urban decay.
*   **Tone:** The tone is **"beautifully grotesque."** While it features extreme violence and graphic sexual content (often leaning into the **exploitation** genre), it maintains a serious, hard-boiled edge. 
*   **Dark Comedy & "B-Movie" Energy:** While primarily a horror-thriller, there is an undercurrent of **dark comedy** and "B-movie" cheesiness, particularly in the behavior of the perverted mystic Mayart and the over-the-top nature of the demon transformations (e.g., a woman turning into a spider or a literal building).
*   **Themes:**
    *   **Interspecies Unity:** The core conflict revolves around a peace treaty between the Human World and the "Black World" (demon realm).
    *   **Light vs. Darkness:** It explores the duality of the human heart, suggesting that the "monsters" are often manifestations of repressed human urges.
    *   **Optimism:** Despite its dark content, the film ends on a surprisingly **saccharine and optimistic note**, focusing on the potential for a new era of peace through love and biological union.
