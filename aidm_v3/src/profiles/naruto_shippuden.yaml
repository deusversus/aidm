power_system:
  name: Chakra
  mechanics: Chakra is created by mixing Physical Energy from the body's cells with
    Spiritual Energy from the mind. It flows through a pathway system of 361 Tenketsu.
    Shinobi mold this energy using Hand Signs to perform Ninjutsu, Genjutsu, or Taijutsu.
    Advanced forms include Senjutsu, which incorporates Natural Energy, and Kekkei
    Genkai, which are genetic bloodline abilities.
  limitations: Total chakra exhaustion results in death. The Eight Gates act as internal
    limiters that, if bypassed, cause severe physical trauma or death. Elemental techniques
    are subject to a rock-paper-scissors cycle of strengths and weaknesses. Overuse
    of the Mangekyo Sharingan leads to blindness, and failing to balance natural energy
    in Sage Mode causes petrification.
