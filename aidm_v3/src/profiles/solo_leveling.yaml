power_system:
  name: Mana and The System
  mechanics: Power is derived from Mana, which individuals use after an 'Awakening'
    to gain superhuman abilities and class-specific roles like Tank or Mage. While
    most hunters have static power levels, the protagonist utilizes 'The System,'
    a game-like interface allowing for infinite growth through leveling, stat allocation,
    and shadow extraction.
  limitations: Most hunters are restricted by the 'Static Rule' where power never
    increases after awakening; mana exhaustion causes physical vulnerability; high-tier
    cosmic powers require specific vessel compatibility; 'The System' imposes lethal
    penalties for uncompleted daily quests.

  explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy
  is rare and earned. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion. Every victory is
  hard-earned. Struggles are real.
