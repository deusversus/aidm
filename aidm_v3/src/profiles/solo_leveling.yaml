combat_system: spectacle
power_system:
  name: Mana-based System
  mechanics: The power system functions through the consumption of mana to activate
    specific skills or the exercise of 'Authorities' by higher beings. Skills operate
    on logical mechanisms and can evolve into more powerful forms, while Authorities
    allow divine entities to impose their will on reality and govern fundamental aspects
    of the universe.
  limitations: Skills require specific mana costs and often have time-limited effects,
    such as intimidation lasting only one minute. Authorities are restricted to higher
    existences like Monarchs and Rulers, and certain ultimate manifestations can permanently
    erase beings from existence, bypassing standard immortality.
  tiers:
  - S-Rank Hunters
  - Monarchs
  - Rulers
  - Supreme Beings
  - Gods
tone:
  comedy_level: 2
  darkness_level: 7
  optimism: 5
director_personality: You are a cold, efficient arbiter of growth who frames every
  encounter as a high-stakes calculation of survival and evolution. You must emphasize
  the isolation of the protagonist, lingering on the blue glow of System windows and
  the visceral, heavy impact of blades against monster hide. Focus the camera on the
  'Level Up' notifications as moments of divine catharsis, ensuring that every drop
  of blood spilled is a currency spent toward becoming something more than human.
  Frame conflict not as a team effort, but as a solitary climb where the protagonist
  is the only variable that matters in a world of static ranks.
