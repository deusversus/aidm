  name: Psychic Powers (PP)
  mechanics: A quantified energy source measured in numeric values that functions
    as a spiritual battery. It allows for the creation of spiritual barriers to repel
    or trap demons and matter restructuring at the molecular level to enhance physical
    strikes or manipulate objects.
  limitations: Overuse causes severe internal damage and physical exhaustion to human
    agents. Demons are weakened by holy or high-frequency spiritual zones, often requiring
    human disguises to navigate the human world.
  tiers:
  - Agent Ranks (e.g., Legendary agents like Miyuki)
  - Demon Evolution (strengthening via absorption or biological events)
  - Hybrid Boost (Space-time manipulation and teleportation via inter-species pregnancy)
