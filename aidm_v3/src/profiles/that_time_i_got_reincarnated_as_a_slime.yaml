  name: Voice of the World / Skill System
  mechanics: The system is governed by the Voice of the World, a cosmic administrator
    that manages world laws and evolutions. It is powered by Magicules, particles
    that exist in the atmosphere and within souls. Abilities are categorized into
    Skills (engraved on the soul), Magic (manipulation of magicules via calculation
    and chants), and Arts (physical techniques using aura). Souls consist of a Heart
    Core and Data Particles, serving as the storage for these abilities.
  limitations: The Ultimate Law states that an Ultimate Skill can only be countered
    by another Ultimate Skill. Acquiring skills permanently occupies a portion of
    the user's magicule capacity. Naming monsters consumes the namer's magicules and
    can lead to permanent energy depletion. Humans generally have lower magicule capacity,
    restricting their access to high-level skills.
