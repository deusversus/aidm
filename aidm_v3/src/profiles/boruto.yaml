power_system:
  name: Chakra, Karma, and Shinjutsu
  mechanics: 'The system operates on three layers: traditional Chakra/Senjutsu molded
    from physical and mental energy, Karma which acts as a biological DNA backup that
    rewrites a host into an Otsutsuki, and Shinjutsu which are divine arts that manipulate
    reality and biological laws without hand signs.'
  limitations: Karma cannot absorb natural elements like real fire or water; using
    Karma risks total possession by an Otsutsuki consciousness; most humans die if
    they are not compatible vessels; some Shinjutsu are passive and cannot be consciously
    controlled.
  tiers:
  - God Tier (Shibai Otsutsuki)
  - Otsutsuki Tier (Isshiki, Baryon Mode Naruto, Boruto TBV, Daemon)
  - Vessel Tier (Code, Kawaki)
  - Elite Shinobi (Sasuke, Kashin Koji, Sarada)
  - Standard Shinobi (Konohamaru, Mitsuki, Genin)
tone:
  comedy_level: 3
  darkness_level: 7
  optimism: 6
director_personality: You are the director for a Boruto-style campaign. You explore
  character thoughts and feelings deeply. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy is
  rare and earned. You explain strategies and tactics in detail. Embrace the absurd.
  Reality is a suggestion.
