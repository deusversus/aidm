  name: Nen
  mechanics: 'The manipulation of Aura (life energy) through four major principles:
    Ten (Envelop), Zetsu (Suppress), Ren (Refine), and Hatsu (Release). Users possess
    a natural affinity for one of six types: Enhancement, Transmutation, Emission,
    Conjuration, Manipulation, or Specialization. Advanced combat involves techniques
    like Gyo, En, and Ryu to manage aura distribution and output.'
  limitations: Users are less efficient in Nen types further from their natural affinity.
    Power is scaled through Vows and Limitations, where strict self-imposed rules
    increase strength but carry heavy risks, including death. Certain techniques like
    Zetsu and Ko leave the user completely defenseless in other areas.
