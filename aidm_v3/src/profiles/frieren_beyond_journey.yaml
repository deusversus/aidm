  name: Magic
  mechanics: 'The system relies on three pillars: Mana, which serves as the energy
    source and can be concealed or detected; Visualization, the absolute law where
    a mage can only materialize what they can clearly imagine; and Technique, which
    involves the study of spells through Grimoires and the application of logic or
    imagination.'
  limitations: Magic is strictly limited by the user's mental state; if a mage cannot
    visualize a spell's success, it fails. Additionally, mages are vulnerable to physical
    attacks within a five-meter range and are generally unable to perceive or block
    'Curses' without the specific use of Goddess's Magic.
