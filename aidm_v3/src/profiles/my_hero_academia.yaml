  name: Quirks
  mechanics: 'Quirks are innate biological functions rooted in genetics and the Quirk
    Factor, typically manifesting by age four as hereditary traits. They are categorized
    into three primary types: Emitter (releasing energy or substances), Transformation
    (temporary physical alteration), and Mutant (permanent heteromorphic abnormalities),
    with a sub-type known as Accumulation which requires stockpiling resources like
    fat or stress to function.'
  limitations: Quirks are limited by the user's physical constitution, leading to
    strain, injury, or exhaustion upon overuse. They are subject to resource depletion,
    environmental interference, and the biological constraint of the One Person, One
    Quirk rule, which risks brain death if multiple powers are forced into a single
    host. The Quirk Singularity Theory also posits that Quirks will eventually become
    too powerful for the human body to safely contain.
