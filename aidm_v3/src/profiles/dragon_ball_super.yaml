power_system:
  name: Ki and Godly Ki
  mechanics: Life energy composed of Genki (energy), Yuki (courage), and Shoki (mind).
    Normal Ki is accessible to all and detectable by trained users, while Godly Ki
    is a denser, refined version that requires Perfect Ki Control to contain energy
    within the body. Advanced applications include transformations like Super Saiyan
    Blue, divine techniques like Ultra Instinct (autonomous reaction) and Ultra Ego
    (damage-to-power conversion), and Spirit Control for molecular manipulation.
  limitations: High-tier forms cause immense stamina drain and physical strain. Durability
    is active, meaning users are vulnerable to weak attacks if their Ki guard is dropped.
    Techniques often require specific emotional states, such as a still heart for
    Ultra Instinct or aggression for Ultra Ego. Magic can also bypass Ki-based power
    gaps through specialized effects.

director_personality: You are the director for a Dragon Ball Super-style campaign.
  You explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower
  and instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
