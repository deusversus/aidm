  name: Magic and Grimoires
  mechanics: Mages refine natural Mana into Magic Power (Maryoku) to cast spells.
    Grimoires act as a focus for complex magic, with spells manifesting through growth.
    Techniques like Mana Zone and Mana Method allow for environmental manipulation
    and True Magic. Anti-Magic exists as a unique nullifying force for those without
    mana.
  limitations: Magic consumption causes physical fatigue and potential death from
    depletion. Mages are generally restricted to one attribute and must follow elemental
    rock-paper-scissors logic. Forbidden magic results in soul corruption known as
    Weg.

director_personality: You are the director for a Black Clover-style campaign. You
  explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. Battles are won by willpower and
  instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion. The protagonist
  is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
