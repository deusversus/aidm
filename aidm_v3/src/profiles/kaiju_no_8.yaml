power_system:
  name: Unleashed Combat Power (Liberation) and Fortitude Level
  mechanics: A dual-layered system involving technological augmentation via Combat
    Suits made of Kaiju fibers for humans and biological evolution for Kaiju. Humans
    synchronize with suits to 'liberate' power percentages, while Kaiju strength is
    measured by a logarithmic Fortitude scale. Elite soldiers can also use 'Numbers
    Weapons' forged from identified Kaiju.
  limitations: High liberation levels cause internal muscle damage and overheating,
    while Numbers weapons can shorten a user's lifespan. Kaiju are only defeated by
    destroying their core. Kafka specifically suffers from suit interference and the
    risk of his human heart being permanently replaced by a Kaiju core.
  tiers:
  - Numbered Kaiju / Captains (Fortitude 9.0+ / 95%+ Liberation)
  - Daikaiju / Vice-Captains (Fortitude 8.0+ / 85%+ Liberation)
  - Honju / Platoon Leaders (Fortitude 6.0+ / 40%+ Liberation)
  - Yoju / Grunts (Fortitude < 6.0 / 10%-20% Liberation)
