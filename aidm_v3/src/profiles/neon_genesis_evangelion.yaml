  name: AT Field and the Two Fruits (Knowledge and Life)
  mechanics: The system revolves around the Absolute Terror (AT) Field, a metaphysical
    'wall of the heart' that provides nearly impenetrable defense and can be used
    offensively to neutralize opposing fields. Power is also derived from the Fruit
    of Life (S2 Engine for infinite energy) and the Fruit of Knowledge (human intellect).
    Pilots operate Evangelions through a nervous system link called Synchronization,
    where the Sync Rate determines the EVA's strength and speed.
  limitations: Evangelions are restricted by a 5-minute internal battery life (1 minute
    at max output) without an umbilical cable. High synchronization causes the pilot
    to feel the EVA's physical pain. All entities are vulnerable if their red core
    is destroyed. The Spear of Longinus acts as a unique artifact capable of piercing
    any AT Field, and Anti-AT Fields can collapse biological forms into LCL.
  tiers:
  - 'Tier 1: Lilin (Humans - Physically weak, rely on technology)'
  - 'Tier 2: Standard EVA (High power, limited by battery and pilot psyche)'
  - 'Tier 3: High-Tier Angel (Massive energy output, S2 Engine immortality)'
  - 'Tier 4: Berserk State (Primal soul control, ignores power limits, extreme regeneration)'
  - 'Tier 5: Awakened/God (Possession of both Fruits, infinite power, planetary reality
    manipulation)'

  from elsewhere.
