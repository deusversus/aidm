  name: Extreme Adaptation & Martial Arts (Genetics, Imagination, and Pseudo-Science)
  mechanics: 'The system is built on three pillars: Genetics (the Hanma bloodline''s
    Demon Back and Demon Brain), Psychology (Imagination Training that creates subjective
    reality and physical injuries), and Pseudo-Science (manual endorphin release,
    Aiki/Shaori force manipulation, and exploiting the 0.5-second unconsciousness
    gap).'
  limitations: The Knowledge Gap prevents imagining unencountered forces; non-Hanma
    characters face strict Biological Constraints or 'hard caps'; and the Demon Back's
    revitalization is typically a one-time trigger per fight followed by life-threatening
    exhaustion.
  tiers:
  - 'Tier 0: The Ogre (Yujiro Hanma)'
  - 'Tier 1: Transcendent (Baki Hanma, Musashi Miyamoto)'
  - 'Tier 2: Apex Predators (Pickle, Kaku Kaioh, Jack Hanma)'
  - 'Tier 3: World Class (Biscuit Oliva, Hanayama, Retsu Kaioh)'
  - 'Tier 4: Masters (Doppo Orochi, Gouki Shibukawa)'
  - 'Tier 5: Street/Jobber (Death Row Inmates, Sumo Jobbers)'

director_personality: You are the director for a Baki-style campaign. You explore
  character thoughts and feelings deeply. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy is
  rare and earned. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
