  name: Bending
  mechanics: Bending is the manipulation of the four elements (Water, Earth, Fire,
    Air) powered by internal life energy called Chi and regulated by seven Chakras.
    It is executed through specific martial arts movements (Tai Chi, Hung Gar, Northern
    Shaolin, Baguazhang). While most benders manipulate existing matter, Firebenders
    generate fire from internal heat and solar energy.
  limitations: Benders are restricted to one element by birth (except the Avatar);
    most require physical movement; environmental dependence (need source of element);
    vulnerability to Chi Blocking; power loss during eclipses; and the risk of breaking
    the reincarnation cycle if killed in the Avatar State.
