## Characters
*My Hero Academia: Vigilantes* is a prequel spin-off manga (and upcoming anime) set several years before the main series. It explores the "gray area" of hero society, focusing on individuals who perform heroic deeds without a professional license.

### **The Protagonist: Koichi Haimawari**
*   **Alias:** The Crawler (formerly "Nice Guy," later "Skycrawler").
*   **Role:** An ordinary college student who missed his chance to become a pro hero. He begins his journey doing "community service" (picking up trash, giving directions) before being recruited into illegal vigilantism.
*   **Abilities (Quirk: Slide and Glide):**
    *   **Initial:** He can slide across any flat surface as long as he has three points of contact (e.g., two feet and one hand).
    *   **Evolution:** Over time, he learns to "glide" on air, stick to walls, and fire "repulsion blasts" (compressed air) from his hands. By the end of the series, his mobility and power rival top-tier pro heroes.
*   **Relationships:** He is the "student" to Knuckleduster and a close friend/teammate to Pop☆Step. He also develops a friendly relationship with **Tensei Iida** (the original Ingenium).

### **The Mentor: Knuckleduster**
*   **Real Identity:** Iwao Oguro (formerly the Pro Hero **O'Clock**).
*   **Role:** The "Batman" of the series. He is a grizzled, quirkless brawler who mentors Koichi in the "dirty" side of fighting.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Current:** Quirkless. He relies on extreme physical conditioning, tactical genius, and various gadgets (brass knuckles, stun grenades, etc.).
    *   **Former (Quirk: Overclock):** Allowed him to accelerate his brain and body to extreme speeds for a few seconds. His quirk was stolen by **All For One**.
*   **Relationships:** He treats Koichi and Pop☆Step with "tough love." His primary motivation is finding his daughter, **Tamao**, whose body was hijacked by a villain.

### **The Heroine: Pop☆Step**
*   **Real Identity:** Kazuho Haneyama.
*   **Role:** A high schooler and "illegal" pop idol who performs guerilla concerts. She serves as the trio's lookout and strategist.
*   **Abilities (Quirk: Leap):**
    *   She can jump incredibly high and far, though she requires a solid surface to push off from. She is not a combatant but excels at evacuation and reconnaissance.
*   **Relationships:** She has a long-standing crush on Koichi, who saved her from drowning when they were children (an event that caused Koichi to miss his hero entrance exam).

### **The Main Antagonist: Number 6**
*   **Alias:** Rokuro Nomura.
*   **Role:** A "blank slate" created by the **Villain Factory** (led by All For One and Dr. Garaki). He is obsessed with becoming the "perfect hero" by stealing the identity of O'Clock.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Overclock:** He possesses the quirk stolen from Knuckleduster, which he uses with lethal efficiency.
    *   **Body Modification:** He can shapeshift, regenerate lost limbs, and turn his body into a living bomb.
*   **Relationships:** He views Koichi as his ultimate rival and "trash" that needs to be disposed of to prove his own worth.

### **Secondary Antagonist: Queen Bee**
*   **Identity:** Kuin Hachisuka (possessing the body of Tamao Oguro).
*   **Role:** An operative for the Villain Factory who distributes **Trigger**, a drug that boosts quirks but causes users to lose their sanity.
*   **Abilities (Quirk: Queen Bee):**
    *   A parasitic quirk that allows a hive-mind of bees to inhabit and control a human host. The bees can inject others with Trigger or act as remote surveillance.
*   **Relationships:** Her possession of Tamao makes her the personal nemesis of Knuckleduster.

### **Key Relationships & Dynamics**
*   **The Naruhata Trio:** Koichi (the heart), Knuckleduster (the muscle/tactics), and Pop☆Step (the spirit). They operate out of the Naruhata district, often cleaning up messes that Pro Heroes ignore.
*   **Pro Hero Connections:** Unlike the main series, the vigilantes have a complicated relationship with the law. **Eraser Head (Aizawa)** and **Midnight** frequently appear, often turning a blind eye to the trio's activities because they recognize the good they are doing.
*   **The Villain Factory:** This organization serves as the overarching threat, using the vigilantes as "test data" for their experiments, which eventually lead to the creation of the **Nomu** seen in the main series.

## Locations
*My Hero Academia: Vigilantes* is set approximately **five to six years before** the main series. While it shares the same world, its focus shifts from the elite hero schools of Musutafu to the "gray areas" of society, primarily centering on the **Naruhata** district.

### **1. Primary Setting: Naruhata (Tokyo)**
Naruhata is a fictional residential and commercial district in Tokyo. It is portrayed as a "forgotten" neighborhood that lacks a consistent Pro Hero presence, which allows both low-level crime and vigilantism to flourish.

*   **Koichi’s Penthouse (The Rooftop):** The unofficial headquarters for the Naruhata Vigilantes (The Crawler, Knuckleduster, and Pop☆Step). It is a small, cluttered apartment on the roof of an older building where the trio meets to plan patrols and investigate the "Trigger" drug.
*   **Marukane Department Store:** A local landmark where Pop☆Step frequently performs her "guerrilla" idol concerts. It serves as a community hub and is the site of several early villain encounters.
*   **Naruhata Park:** A common meeting spot for the protagonists, often used for training or quiet character moments.
*   **Naruhata Hospital:** A recurring location where victims of the Trigger drug are treated. In the final arc, it becomes a high-security site during the "Naruhata Lockdown."
*   **The Back Alleys:** Much of the series takes place in the labyrinthine alleys of Naruhata. These areas represent the "darkness" of the city where the Villain Factory operates and where Eraser Head (Aizawa) frequently patrols.

### **2. Major Landmarks & Arc Locations**
As the story progresses, the characters travel to other significant locations within Japan:

*   **The Sky Egg (Tokyo):** A massive, fictional egg-shaped tower and stadium based on the real-life Tokyo Skytree and Tokyo Dome. It is the centerpiece of the **Sky Egg Arc**, where a massive terrorist attack occurs during Captain Celebrity’s farewell party.
*   **SS Mall (Osaka):** Located in the **Naniwa/Super Minami** district of Osaka. This is the setting for the "Osaka Incident Arc," where Koichi and Pop☆Step assist the Pro Hero **Fat Gum** in stopping a Trigger-related outbreak at a mascot festival.
*   **Underground Masquerade:** A secret, illegal fighting ring located in an undisclosed urban basement. It is where Knuckleduster (as the former hero O'Clock) investigated the origins of the Villain Factory and where a young **Mirko** made an early appearance.

### **3. Villain Bases & Organizations**
*   **Onomura Pharma Corp:** A pharmaceutical company that serves as a front and manufacturing hub for the **Villain Factory**. It is used to mass-produce the "Trigger" drug and bioengineer "Next-Level Villains" and "Bombers."
*   **The Villain Factory Hideouts:** Various temporary labs and warehouses scattered around the outskirts of Naruhata where Dr. Garaki and Number 6 conduct experiments.

### **4. World Geography & International Setting**
*   **Rhode Island (USA):** Mentioned in the lore as the birthplace of the Pro Hero industry. The series explains that the "Rhode Island New State Statute" was the first law to formalize vigilantes into licensed Pro Heroes.
*   **New York City (USA):** Following the conclusion of the series, the protagonist Koichi Haimawari relocates to New York to work as a licensed Pro Hero under the name **Skycrawler**, operating out of the United States to avoid legal repercussions in Japan.
*   **Hong Kong:** Briefly mentioned as a location where Knuckleduster travels to investigate the international distribution of the Trigger drug.

### **5. Geography Trivia: The "Star Wars" Connection**
Following the tradition of the main series (where locations like *Mustafu* and *Aldera* are named after *Star Wars* planets), the geography of *Vigilantes* follows suit:
*   **Naruhata** is a play on **Nal Hutta** (the Hutt home world).
*   **Naniwa** (Osaka) and other minor districts often incorporate subtle nods to the franchise's expanded universe.

## Power System
*My Hero Academia: Vigilantes* (a prequel set roughly five years before the main series) provides a deeper, more technical look at the Quirk system, focusing on "street-level" applications, illegal enhancement, and the biological evolution of powers.

### 1. Power System Mechanics
The core power system remains **Quirks**, but *Vigilantes* introduces unique mechanical layers not emphasized in the main series:

*   **Quirk Evolution vs. Awakening:** While the main series features "Awakenings" (sudden power jumps during life-or-death stress), *Vigilantes* showcases **Evolution**—a gradual process where a user realizes their Quirk’s true nature. For example, Koichi Haimawari initially believes his Quirk is "sliding," but eventually learns it is actually the manipulation of **attractive and repulsive forces**.
*   **Subconscious Suppression:** The series explores how psychological trauma or childhood "conditioning" can limit a Quirk. Koichi’s mother swatted him as a baby to stop him from floating away, causing him to subconsciously limit his Quirk to "sliding" on the ground for years.
*   **Artificial Enhancement (Trigger):** A central plot device is **Trigger**, an illegal drug that:
    *   **Boosts Potency:** Dramatically increases the output of a Quirk.
    *   **Lowers Rationality:** Users often lose their sense of reason, becoming "Instant Villains."
    *   **Physical Markers:** Heavy users develop a **black tongue** due to circulatory damage.
    *   **Ideo-Trigger:** A more potent variant that can permanently mutate the user into a "Next-Level Villain."

### 2. Key Abilities & Character Archetypes
*   **The Crawler (Koichi Haimawari):** His Quirk, *Slide and Glide*, evolves from a simple mobility tool into a high-tier combat ability capable of firing "Shooty-Go-Blam" (repulsive air blasts), creating force fields, and achieving true flight.
*   **Knuckleduster (Iwao Oguro):** A rare **Quirkless** combatant. He relies on extreme physical conditioning, psychological warfare, and specialized gear (brass knuckles, tasers, and painkillers) to defeat Quirk users. He represents the "Batman" archetype in the MHA universe.
*   **Number 6:** An artificial human created by the **Villain Factory**. He possesses multiple Quirks, including *Overclock* (extreme speed/perception), *Regeneration*, and *Detonation*.

### 3. Rules & Legal Restrictions
The series heavily explores the **Quirk Restriction Laws**:
*   **The Rhode Island Statute:** The historical basis for modern hero laws. It established that only government-sanctioned individuals (Pro Heroes) can use Quirks in public.
*   **Vigilantism is Illegal:** Using a Quirk to fight crime without a license is a criminal act. Vigilantes are technically "villains" in the eyes of the law, regardless of their intent.
*   **Registration Accuracy:** Citizens must register their Quirks with the government. *Vigilantes* shows that many people have "misregistered" Quirks because they don't fully understand their own biology.

### 4. Limitations & Drawbacks
*   **Physical Strain:** Most Quirks have a "fuel" or physical limit. *Overclock*, for instance, allows the user to move so fast the world seems frozen, but it can only be used for as long as the user can hold their breath, and it puts immense strain on the brain.
*   **Environmental Requirements:** Some Quirks have specific triggers. Pop Step’s *Leap* requires a solid surface to jump from; if she is in mid-air without a platform, she is vulnerable.
*   **Drug Dependency:** Characters like Knuckleduster must use heavy doses of painkillers to maintain their fighting form due to the long-term damage of fighting Quirk users without a Quirk of their own.

### 5. Power Tiers & Progression
While the main series scales to "World-Ending" threats, *Vigilantes* operates on a more grounded scale:

| Tier | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S-Tier (Symbol Level)** | Characters capable of ending major conflicts instantly. | All Might, Endeavor (Younger version). |
| **A-Tier (Top Pro Level)** | Highly versatile and powerful; can handle "Next-Level Villains." | Captain Celebrity, Eraser Head, Skycrawler (End-game Koichi). |
| **B-Tier (Street Level)** | Skilled vigilantes and average Pro Heroes. | Knuckleduster, Fat Gum (Younger), Pop Step. |
| **C-Tier (Impromptu)** | Common citizens or "Instant Villains" using Trigger. | Teruo Unagizawa, various Trigger addicts. |

**Progression Path (The Koichi Model):**
1.  **The Nice Guy:** Basic mobility, 3 points of contact required, bike-level speed.
2.  **The Crawler:** 2 points of contact, wall-crawling, bus-level speed.
3.  **The Skycrawler:** Flight, long-range repulsion blasts, "Reactive Armor" (automatic force fields), and high-speed aerial combat.

## Factions
*My Hero Academia: Vigilantes* (a prequel set roughly five years before the main series) expands the lore of the MHA universe by focusing on the "gray area" of unsanctioned heroism. The world is defined by a strict legal divide between licensed Pro Heroes and illegal Vigilantes, with a hidden pharmaceutical conspiracy driving the conflict.

### **1. Major Factions & Organizations**

#### **The Naruhata Vigilantes (Protagonists)**
A small, grassroots group operating out of the Naruhata district in Tokyo. They handle low-level crimes that Pro Heroes often overlook.
*   **The Crawler (Koichi Haimawari):** A college student with the "Slide and Glide" Quirk. He starts as a "Nice Guy" doing community service and evolves into a highly skilled combatant.
*   **Knuckleduster (Iwao Oguro):** The group’s brawny mentor. He is Quirkless (having had his Quirk stolen) and relies on gadgets, tactical genius, and raw physical strength.
*   **Pop☆Step (Kazuho Haneyama):** A high schooler and "illegal idol" who uses her "Leap" Quirk to perform street concerts and provide aerial reconnaissance.

#### **The Villain Factory (Primary Antagonists)**
A shadow organization led by **All For One** and **Dr. Kyudai Garaki**. Their goal is to collect combat data to perfect the bio-engineering of **Nomu**.
*   **Number 6 (Rokuro Nomura):** The main field antagonist. A "Next-Level Villain" created by the factory, he possesses the stolen "Overclock" Quirk and a hive-mind connection to "Anonymous" drones.
*   **Kuin Hachisuka (Queen Bee):** An agent who uses a parasitic bee Quirk to control hosts and distribute the drug **Trigger**.
*   **The "Anonymous" & "Bombers":** Mindless, mass-produced bio-constructs used as suicide bombers or distraction forces. They are the "proto-Nomus" of the series.

#### **Soga’s Group**
Originally a gang of street thugs led by **Soga Kugizaki**, they transition into reluctant allies of the Naruhata Vigilantes. They provide street-level intel and eventually help protect the community during major crises.

---

### **2. World Powers & Societal Structures**

The series provides deep insight into how the "Hero System" became a global standard:
*   **The Rhode Island New State Statute:** This is the historical "world power" event mentioned in the series. It was the first legislation (passed in the U.S.) that officially licensed vigilantes as "Pro Heroes," effectively outlawing all other Quirk usage. 
*   **The United States vs. Japan:** The U.S. is depicted as having a more "lax" and commercialized hero culture. **Captain Celebrity**, the top U.S. hero, relocates to Japan to escape scandals, highlighting the international mobility of top-tier heroes.
*   **The Hero Public Safety Commission:** While present, they are shown to be more focused on the transition from the chaotic "Vigilante Era" to the regulated "Hero Era," often using the police to suppress unlicensed activity.

---

### **3. Alliances & Enemies**

#### **The "Necessary Evil" Alliance**
*   **Police & Vigilantes:** **Detective Naomasa Tsukauchi** and his superior **Eizo Tanuma** represent the two sides of the law. While Tsukauchi is "by the book," Tanuma often turns a blind eye to the Naruhata Vigilantes, viewing them as a "necessary evil" to deal with underground threats the police cannot legally touch.
*   **Pro Hero Cooperation:** Several Pro Heroes grudgingly or secretly assist the vigilantes. **Eraser Head (Aizawa)** and **Fat Gum** frequently cross paths with them, while **Ingenium (Tensei Iida)** acts as a mentor to Koichi, even offering him a legal path into heroics.

#### **The Underground Masquerade**
An illegal, high-stakes underground fighting circuit in Osaka. It serves as a meeting ground for various factions:
*   **O'Clock (Knuckleduster's former hero persona)**, **Rappa** (later of the Shie Hassaikai), and a young **Mirko** formed a temporary, shaky alliance here to take down a common threat.

---

### **4. Key Conflict Drivers**
*   **Trigger (The Drug):** A Quirk-enhancing drug that is the central "enemy" of the series. It boosts a user's power while destroying their rationality, turning them into **"Instant Villains."** The Villain Factory uses its distribution to test Quirk potential.
*   **The Stendhal/Stain Conflict:** Before becoming the "Hero Killer," **Chizome Akaguro** operated as the vigilante **Stendhal**. His transition from a vigilante who kills "true villains" to a villain who kills "false heroes" is a major plot point, sparked by his defeat at the hands of Knuckleduster.

## Combat
*My Hero Academia: Vigilantes* (also known as *Vigilante: Boku no Hero Academia Illegals*) offers a combat experience that is significantly more grounded, tactical, and grittier than the main series. While the main series focuses on "chosen ones" with world-shaking powers, *Vigilantes* explores how "mediocre" quirks and quirkless ingenuity can be weaponized through street-level experience.

### **1. Combat & Fighting Styles**
The series features a "trio" dynamic where each character represents a different approach to combat:

*   **Koichi Haimawari (The Crawler): The "Rules-Lawyer"**
    *   **Style:** Initially defensive and movement-based. Koichi’s quirk, **Slide and Glide**, requires three points of contact with a surface to move. 
    *   **Evolution:** His style is a masterclass in quirk evolution. He learns to "rules-lawyer" his power: sticking to walls (attraction), braking (applying reverse force), and eventually "double-jumping" by repelling off the air itself. 
    *   **Offense:** He develops the **"Shooty-Go-Blam"** (repulsion blasts from his palms) and **Knuckle Style**, where he coats his fists in high-density repulsion fields to deliver explosive punches, a technique inspired by his mentor.
*   **Knuckleduster: The Quirkless Brawler**
    *   **Style:** Brutal, street-level brawling. As a quirkless man (formerly the speedster hero **O'Clock**), he relies on physical conditioning, brass knuckles, and tactical gadgets.
    *   **Tactics:** He uses psychological warfare and environmental awareness. In his fight against **Stendhal (Stain)**, he uses a "line in the sand" tactic to bait the villain into a trap, proving that experience can overcome supernatural speed.
*   **Pop☆Step: Support & Recon**
    *   **Style:** Her quirk, **Leap**, is primarily for mobility and crowd control. She acts as the "eyes in the sky," coordinating evacuations and providing first aid.
    *   **Villain Turn:** When possessed by **Queen Bee**, her style shifts to a "bomber" role, using exploding bees to create chaos, forcing Koichi to adapt his defensive style into a rescue-focused combat mode.

### **2. Tactical Ingenuity**
Unlike the "power-up" nature of the main series, *Vigilantes* battles are often won through **logical application of physics and law**:
*   **Legal Loopholes:** In a famous encounter with **Eraser Head**, Knuckleduster avoids arrest because he is quirkless. Since he isn't using a quirk illegally, he technically falls outside of hero jurisdiction at that moment, a tactical "win" that leaves Aizawa frustrated.
*   **Environmental Combat:** Battles often take place in narrow alleys or crowded cityscapes. Koichi frequently uses the "urban jungle" to his advantage, sliding up buildings to escape or using the momentum of a fall to increase the force of his repulsion blasts.

### **3. Emotional Weight**
The emotional core of the combat lies in the **personal stakes** and **legacy**:
*   **The Sky Egg Incident:** A massive spectacle where Captain Celebrity (a flashy, Superman-esque hero) must hold up a falling stadium. The emotional weight comes from his transition from a self-centered celebrity to a true hero, willing to die to protect civilians while his "protective barrier" thins out.
*   **Tensei Iida (Ingenium):** The series provides the backstory for Tenya Iida’s brother. His combat scenes are bittersweet for fans, as they show the peak of his "Team Idaten" tactics before his tragic encounter with Stain.
*   **Koichi vs. Pop☆Step:** The battle to save a brainwashed Pop☆Step is the series' emotional peak, as Koichi must fight his best friend while being hunted by pro heroes like **Endeavor**, who view him as a criminal.

### **4. Flashy Spectacle & Aesthetic**
The series leans heavily into a **Western Comic Book aesthetic**:
*   **Visual Flair:** The manga (and the 2025 anime adaptation) uses prominent onomatopoeia (e.g., "CRASH," "BOOM") as physical elements of the art. 
*   **Marvel Influence:** The anime features guest art by Marvel’s **RB Silva** for scenes set in the United States, blending American comic styles with Japanese animation.
*   **The Final Showdown:** The battle against **Number Six** is the ultimate spectacle. Number Six uses a "Lightning Style" (plasma-based explosions) that creates a visually stunning contrast to Koichi’s blue repulsion rings. The fight spans several chapters and involves multi-stage transformations, rivaling the scale of the main series' final arcs.

### **Anime Status (As of 2026)**
*   **Season 1:** Aired April–June 2025, produced by **Bones Film** and directed by **Kenichi Suzuki** (*JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*). It was praised for its "gritty" art direction and comic-book-inspired animation.
*   **Season 2:** Officially scheduled to premiere on **January 5, 2026**, covering the "Naruhata Lockdown" and the tragic "Bee Pop" arc.

## Tone
*My Hero Academia: Vigilantes* (also known as *Vigilante: Boku no Hero Academia Illegals*) is a prequel spin-off that explores the "gray zones" of a superhuman society. While it shares the same universe as the main series, its tone and execution are distinct, leaning into street-level realism and more mature themes.

### **1. Tone: Gritty but Energetic**
The tone of *Vigilantes* is often described as **darker and more grounded** than the main series. While *My Hero Academia* focuses on the "Symbol of Peace" and high-stakes battles at UA High, *Vigilantes* operates in the shadows and back alleys.
*   **Street-Level Realism:** The stakes are personal rather than global. Instead of saving the world, characters save their neighborhood, deal with local drug dealers, and handle "nuisance" crimes that pro heroes ignore.
*   **Electric & Poppy:** Despite its darker subject matter, the series maintains an "electric" and "poppy" energy, often using comic-book-style onomatopoeias (e.g., "BOOM," "POW") and a vibrant, expressive art style that feels like a 90s Western comic.

### **2. Themes: Identity and Community**
*   **What it Means to be a Hero:** The central theme is the definition of heroism outside the legal system. It asks if someone is a "hero" because of a license or because of their actions.
*   **Identity & Maturity:** The protagonist, Koichi, is a young adult (19 at the start) navigating the transition into adulthood. The series explores finding one's place in a society that has already labeled you as "average" or "unlicensed."
*   **Structural Discrimination:** It delves into how the hero system polices bodies and quirks, often criminalizing those with "villainous-looking" powers or those who use their quirks for harmless, everyday help.

### **3. Dark Comedy: The Absurdity of Violence**
*Vigilantes* utilizes a specific brand of **dark comedy** that stems from the juxtaposition of everyday life and brutal vigilantism.
*   **Knuckleduster’s Brutality:** Much of the comedy comes from Knuckleduster, a quirkless, middle-aged man who "punches first and asks questions never." His extreme violence against low-level thugs is often played for laughs, contrasting with Koichi’s polite, "Nice Guy" persona.
*   **Juxtaposition:** The series will often pivot from a lighthearted scene of Koichi picking up litter to a "grim" encounter with a drug-addled villain, creating a jarring but effective comedic-to-serious flow.

### **4. Optimism: The "Nice Guy" Core**
Despite the "grimey" setting, the series is fundamentally **optimistic**, largely due to its protagonist, Koichi Haimawari (The Crawler).
*   **Unconditional Kindness:** Koichi represents a pure, "un-chosen" heroism. Unlike Deku, he wasn't given a legendary power; he simply chooses to help because "someone has to." 
*   **Internal Growth:** The optimism is found in Koichi’s persistence. He turns a "weak" quirk (sliding) into a versatile tool through sheer creativity and hard work, proving that even "nobodies" can make a massive difference.

### **5. Atmosphere: The Urban Underbelly**
The atmosphere is **nocturnal and intimate**. 
*   **Setting:** Most of the action takes place at night in the Naruhata district. The atmosphere is thick with the feeling of a "lived-in" city—neon lights, rainy alleys, and crowded convenience stores.
*   **The "Trigger" Threat:** The recurring presence of "Trigger" (a quirk-enhancing drug) adds a layer of tension and body horror, making the world feel dangerous and unpredictable.

### **6. Genre & Mood**
*   **Genre:** A hybrid of **Superhero, Action, Comedy, and Seinen-lite (Mature Shonen)**. It also incorporates elements of **Slice of Life**, as we see the characters' daily routines and part-time jobs.
*   **Mood:** The mood is **"Electric-Grim."** It can be incredibly funny and heartwarming one moment, then terrifyingly violent the next. It feels like a "side quest" that eventually reveals itself to be the foundation of the entire *My Hero* world.

### **Comparison Summary**
| Feature | *My Hero Academia* | *MHA: Vigilantes* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stakes** | Global / "Avengers-level" | Local / Street-level |
| **Protagonist** | Chosen successor (Deku) | Self-made "Nice Guy" (Koichi) |
| **Primary Setting** | UA High School / Day | Naruhata District / Night |
| **Humor** | High school antics | Dark comedy / Absurdist violence |
| **Mood** | Inspirational / Grandiose | Grounded / Gritty |
