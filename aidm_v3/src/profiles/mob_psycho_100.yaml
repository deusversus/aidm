  name: Psychic Energy (Psychokinesis)
  mechanics: Powers are fueled by the user's spirit and mental state, with potency directly tied to emotional intensity. High-level users can transfer or absorb energy, and Shigeo Kageyama specifically triggers '100%' explosions or a primal '???' state based on emotional stress.
  limitations: Users typically face difficulty performing multiple psychic tasks simultaneously and suffer from physical strain or bodily breakdown if they exceed their capacity to contain energy.
  tiers:
  - God Tier (Mob ???%, Toichiro Suzuki 100%, Keiji Mogami)
  - High Tier (Mob 100% states, Serizawa, Shimazaki)
  - Mid Tier (Teruki Hanazawa, Sho Suzuki, Ritsu Kageyama)
tone:
  comedy_level: 7

director_personality: You are the director for a Mob Psycho 100-style campaign. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion.
