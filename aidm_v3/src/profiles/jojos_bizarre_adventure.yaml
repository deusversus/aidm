  name: Hamon, Stands, and The Spin
  mechanics: Hamon uses controlled breathing to generate solar energy in the blood.
    Stands are physical manifestations of fighting spirit that reflect damage to the
    user. The Spin utilizes the Golden Ratio to create infinite rotational energy.
  limitations: Hamon requires constant breathing and a conductive medium. Stands reflect
    damage to the user and are limited by range and the one-stand rule. The Spin requires
    physical objects and specific natural geometry.
