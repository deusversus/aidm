  name: Soul & Blood Absorption (Control Art Restriction System)
  mechanics: The system is based on the principle that 'Blood is the coinage of the
    soul.' When a vampire consumes blood, they absorb the victim's entire existence,
    including memories and skills. These souls act as a stock of extra lives for instant
    regeneration and can be manifested as familiars. Alucard specifically operates
    under the Control Art Restriction System, which seals his power behind alchemical
    levels.
  limitations: To become a vampire, the victim must be a virgin; otherwise, they turn
    into a mindless Ghoul. Vampires are weakened by sunlight, silver, and holy weapons,
    and cannot enter private residences without an invitation. At Level 0, the user
    is highly vulnerable because all stored souls are externalized, meaning a single
    strike to the heart can cause permanent death.
  tiers:
  - Level 0 (Ultimate Release/Undead Army)
  - Level 1 & 2 (Shadow Manifestation/Baskerville)
  - Level 3 to 6 (Standard Combat/Restricted)
  - True Vampires
  - Werewolves
  - Regenerators
  - Artificial Vampires
  - Fledglings
  - Ghouls

director_personality: You are the director for a Hellsing Ultimate-style campaign.
  You explore character thoughts and feelings deeply. You maintain dramatic weight;
  comedy is rare and earned. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess
  moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality is a suggestion. Every victory is hard-earned.
  Struggles are real.
