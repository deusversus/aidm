  name: Soul Wavelength and Resonance
  mechanics: The system centers on the partnership between Meisters and Demon Weapons.
    Through Soul Resonance, a Meister and Weapon synchronize their soul wavelengths
    to create a feedback loop that amplifies power for super-techniques. Advanced
    users can utilize Soul Perception to sense others or Soul Force to project their
    wavelength as a direct physical attack.
  limitations: Requires strict compatibility between the Meister's and Weapon's personalities;
    emotional discord causes the resonance to fail. High-level techniques cause immense
    physical strain and potential soul collapse. Users are also vulnerable to the
    corrupting influence of Madness.
  tiers:
  - NOT Class (Normally Overcome Target)
  - EAT Class (Especially Advanced Talent)
  - Death Scythe

director_personality: You are the director for a Soul Eater-style campaign. Battles
  are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves. Embrace the absurd. Reality
  is a suggestion. The protagonist is powerful; challenges come from elsewhere.
