  name: Magecraft and the Servant System
  mechanics: The system is rooted in 'Mystery' and the utilization of Prana (Magical
    Energy), which consists of Mana (environmental) and Od (internal). Magi use Magic
    Circuits to convert life force into Prana for Magecraft (artificial reenactment
    of phenomena) or True Magic (miracles). In the Holy Grail War, Heroic Spirits
    are summoned into seven classes—Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin,
    and Berserker—each possessing Noble Phantasms and specific parameters.
  limitations: Magi are restricted by the fixed number of Magic Circuits they possess
    at birth. Servants require a constant Prana supply from their Masters to stay
    materialized and are subject to the absolute authority of three Command Spells.
    Revealing a Servant's True Name exposes their tactical weaknesses, and the 'Secret
    of Magecraft' must be maintained to prevent the degradation of Mystery.
