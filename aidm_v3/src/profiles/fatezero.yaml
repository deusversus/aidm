  name: Magecraft and Servant System
  mechanics: Powers are fueled by Magical Energy (Prana), which consists of environmental
    Mana and internal life force (Od). This energy is processed through a Magus's
    Magic Circuits to cast spells (Magecraft) or power Mystic Codes. In the Holy Grail
    War, Magi act as Masters who summon and anchor Heroic Spirits (Servants) to the
    physical world by supplying them with Prana. Servants utilize Class Skills, Personal
    Skills, and Noble Phantasms (crystallized mysteries of their legends).
  limitations: Magic Circuits are determined at birth and cannot be increased through
    training. Maintaining a Servant drains massive amounts of mana, which can physically
    rot or kill a weak Master. The 'Rule of Mystery' dictates that magic loses its
    power if exposed to the general public. Masters are limited to exactly three Command
    Spells to control their Servants. Servants are restricted by their summoned Class
    Containers.

  dramatic weight; comedy is rare and earned. You let scenes breathe. Patience is
  a virtue; payoffs are earned. Victories are pyrrhic. The world is harsh. You explain
  strategies and tactics in detail.
