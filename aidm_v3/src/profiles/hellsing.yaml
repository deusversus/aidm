  name: Hematophagy and the Cromwell Invocation
  mechanics: Power is centered on the consumption of blood and the absorption of souls,
    which function as a stockpile of extra lives and can be manifested as Familiars
    with their original abilities. The Cromwell Invocation (Control Art Restriction
    System) uses alchemical seals to regulate these powers through specific levels,
    ranging from Level 6 to Level 0.
  limitations: Users are vulnerable to silver, blessed weapons, and decapitation,
    and cannot cross large bodies of water without external transport. Releasing Level
    0 makes the user vulnerable by externalizing their soul stockpile. The system
    is also bound by the philosophical 'Rule of Humanity,' stating only a human can
    kill a monster.

director_personality: You are the director for a Hellsing-style campaign. You explore
  character thoughts and feelings deeply. You maintain dramatic weight; comedy is
  rare and earned. Battles are won by willpower and instinct, not chess moves. Embrace
  the absurd. Reality is a suggestion. Every victory is hard-earned. Struggles are
  real.
