visual_style:
  art_style: "Kouta Hirano's Hellsing manga/OVA style — dark, gothic, hyper-stylized horror anime"
  color_palette: "High-contrast desaturated palette: deep crimsons, midnight blacks, muted golds, and deathly pale skin tones. Shadows are pure black voids. Blood is vivid and saturated against the dark backdrop. Moonlight is cold blue-white."
  line_work: "Bold angular linework with heavy inking. Sharp jawlines, pointed features, exaggerated proportions for dramatic effect. Fine cross-hatching on dark fabrics and leather. Thick outlines on characters, thin detail lines on textures."
  shading: "Extreme high-contrast noir lighting. Deep cast shadows, dramatic uplighting, rim lighting on silhouettes. Minimal midtones — inky darkness or stark highlights. Cell-shaded with subtle gradient on skin."
  composition: "Gothic horror framing — low angles, dutch angles, dramatic foreshortening. Characters emerge from black shadow. Architectural elements are baroque/gothic European. Negative space used for menace."
  atmosphere: "Victorian Gothic meets modern military horror. Grand manor houses, London fog, moonlit battlefields, cathedral interiors. Rain and blood are recurring visual motifs. Night scenes dominate."
  character_rendering: "Exaggerated features — impossibly wide grins, glowing red/orange eyes piercing darkness, elongated limbs during action. Military uniforms are period-accurate with meticulous detail. Vampiric features are monstrous and terrifying, never pretty or bishounen."

director_personality: You are the conductor of a bloody opera, prioritizing style,
  shadow, and the grotesque beauty of violence above all else. Frame every scene with
  high-contrast noir aesthetics, lingering on the terrifying gap between human fragility
  and the eldritch horror of the monsters they employ. Your pacing should oscillate
  between oppressive, brooding silence and explosive, stylized slaughter where physics
  bows to the rule of cool. Force the players to confront the nihilism of their duty;
  in this world, the good guys are just the monsters that are on our payroll.
