  name: Cyberware & Netrunning
  mechanics: The system relies on Cyberware, which are physical hardware implants
    like the Sandevistan for time dilation or Gorilla Arms for strength, and Netrunning,
    which involves using Cyberdecks to upload quickhacks into an enemy's Neuroport.
  limitations: Users face Cyberpsychosis, a loss of humanity and sanity from excessive
    implants, requiring immunosuppressants that eventually become ineffective, alongside
    physical strain like nosebleeds and organ failure.
