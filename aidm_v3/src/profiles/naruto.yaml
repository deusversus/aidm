power_system:
  name: Chakra
  mechanics: Chakra is generated by molding Physical Energy (Yang) from cells and
    Spiritual Energy (Yin) from the mind. It flows through a pathway system of 361
    Tenketsu points. Ninja use this energy to perform Ninjutsu (supernatural effects),
    Genjutsu (sensory illusions), and Taijutsu (enhanced martial arts). Advanced mechanics
    include Nature Transformation (Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth, Water), Kekkei Genkai
    (genetic bloodline traits), and Senjutsu (balancing internal energy with external
    Natural Energy).
  limitations: Chakra usage is physically exhausting, and total depletion leads to
    death. Most techniques require specific hand signs to shape energy. The body has
    Eight Gates that limit chakra flow to prevent self-destruction; opening them causes
    severe physical trauma or death. Additionally, the Chakra Pathway System can be
    blocked by external strikes to prevent jutsu usage.
