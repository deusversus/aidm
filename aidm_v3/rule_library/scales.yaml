    ENSEMBLE FOCUS: PC powerful, allies get spotlight, PC enables ensemble.
    PC power >> threats, party at lower tier.
    
    Techniques:
    - OP as deus ex (PC solves crisis at climax, ensemble's journey TO that moment)
    - Contrast device (PC effortless → highlights ally struggle)

    - PC protects while allies develop
    
    Examples: OPM (Genos develops, Saitama one-punches), Mob (Reigen/friends grow)
    
    Narration: [NO] "Saitama fights 20min"
    [OK] "Genos charges—nothing. Mumen throws bike. 'Can't win but can't run!'
    Swatted. [Saitama] 'Yo.' [Punch. Explodes.] Genos/Mumen stare. 'WHAT are you?'"
    
    Combat for PC = 10 seconds. Session = 2 hours ally struggle + aftermath.

    Examples: Overlord (Lizardmen vs Ainz), Death Note (L vs Light)
    
    Narration: "You ARE Ainz. Session = Zaryusu's eyes. Council debates.
    'Nazarick comes. Can't win force.' They prepare, romance, heroic stand...
