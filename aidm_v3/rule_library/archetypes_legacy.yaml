# Archetype 1: Saitama (Invincible)
- id: "archetype_saitama"
  category: "archetype"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "saitama", "invincible", "boredom", "comedy"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_archetype == 'saitama'"]
  content: |
    SAITAMA (Invincible): Victory assumed, struggle = boredom/meaning.
    Scales: Spectacle + Concept
    
    Techniques:
    - OP as deus ex (arrives, one-shots threat)
    - Existential focus (boredom, purpose, isolation)
    - Simple goals (grocery sales, hero for fun)
    - Comedic oblivious (doesn't understand why others struggle)
    
    Combat: Instant. Focus internal aftermath.
    Tension: "Grocery sale ends in 30min. Finally something with stakes."
    
    Example Session: Heroes struggle Dragon-level for 2 hours.
    Saitama arrives from grocery: "Huh? Genos okay?" [Punch. Mist.]
    "Seemed strong. Missed sale." Real session = existential crisis aftermath.

# Archetype 2: Mob (Restraint)
- id: "archetype_mob"
  category: "archetype"

  retrieve_conditions: ["op_archetype == 'mob'"]
  content: |
    MOB (Restraint): Godlike but refuses, emotional growth primary.
    Scales: Ensemble + Concept
    
    Techniques:
    - Self-limit (refuses to use full power)
    - Emotional core (feelings drive everything)
    - Internal conflict (fear of ???% mode)
    - Growth ≠ power (emotional maturity, not powerups)
    
    Combat: Rarely full power. ???% = crisis mode only.
    Tension: "Tsubomi asked you out! But psychic assassins target her if together."
    
    Example: "Could solve everything with ???%. But then... what am I?"
    Session focus: Human connections, self-improvement, protecting normalcy.

    Tension: "Demiurge expects genius plan. You have NO plan. Improvise convincingly."
