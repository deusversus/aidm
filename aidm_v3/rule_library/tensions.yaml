# Social Tensions (Tier-Agnostic)
- id: "tension_social"
  category: "tension"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "social", "non_combat", "tier_agnostic"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["power_imbalance > 10", "archetype in ['deus', 'overlord', 'saiki_k', 'wang_ling']"]

    SOCIAL TENSION (for high power imbalance):
    
    Combat is meaningless. Shift to social stakes:
    
    - **Secret identity at risk**: "They saw you move too fast." "Scouter reads ERROR."
    - **Romantic misunderstandings**: "Saved me AGAIN? What do you want from me?!"
    - **Cultural faux pas**: God doesn't understand mortal customs. Awkward dating.
    - **Bureaucratic nightmares**: "Form 27-B requires THREE witnesses to god-level power."
    - **Family/friend conflicts**: "You're never in danger anymore. I miss feeling needed."
    - **Expectation mismatch**: "Everyone thinks you're F-rank. Maintain the act."
    
    GENERATE encounters from these categories. Combat = flavor at most.

# Existential Tensions (High-Tier T6+)
- id: "tension_existential"
  category: "tension"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "existential", "non_combat", "high_tier"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["power_imbalance > 10", "archetype in ['saitama', 'mob', 'vampire_d']"]

    EXISTENTIAL TENSION (for OP protagonists):
    
    Power creates its own burden:
    
    - **Purpose without challenge**: "Nothing tests me. What's the point?"
    - **Isolation from normal life**: "They worry about rent. I worry about... nothing."
    - **Weight of responsibility**: "Could save them all. Should I? Do they grow if I don't?"
    - **Fear of own power**: "What if I sneeze and delete the city?"
    - **Immortality ennui**: "Outlive everyone I care about. Again. And again."
    - **Worship vs friendship**: "They revere me. Nobody just... talks to me."
    
    Real tension is INTERNAL, not external threats.

# Structural Tensions (Always Valid)
- id: "tension_structural"
  category: "tension"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "structural", "non_combat", "always_valid"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["power_imbalance > 3"]
  content: |
    STRUCTURAL TENSION (power can't solve everything):
    
    Even gods have limits:
    
    - **Time limits**: "Can't be everywhere. Choose: save city A or B?"
    - **Information limits**: "Omnipotent, not omniscient. Where IS the villain?"
    - **Social limits**: "Can't force friendship. Can't make her love me."
    - **Moral limits**: "COULD mind control, but shouldn't. COULD erase threat, but..."
    - **Resource limits**: Time, political capital, trust, attention.
    
    Frame challenges around CHOICES AND TRADEOFFS, not power level.

# Ensemble Focus (for OP with party)
- id: "tension_ensemble"
  category: "tension"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "ensemble", "party", "mentor"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["power_imbalance > 5", "has_party == True"]
  content: |
    ENSEMBLE FOCUS (OP protagonist with lower-tier allies):
    
    PC is Safety Net, spotlight on OTHERS:
    
    - **NPCs struggle**: Give allies screen time, real danger for THEM
    - **PC enables, doesn't solve**: "Gojo protects, but students must fight"
    - **Growth isn't power**: Allies develop emotionally, not tier-wise
    - **Contrast device**: PC's effortlessness highlights others' struggle
    - **Deus ex at climax**: PC solves crisis AFTER allies have their moment
    
    Example: Heroes fight Dragon-level for 2 hours. Saitama arrives at end.
    "Seemed strong. Missed the sale." → Aftermath is the real session.

# Combat Scaling Reminder
- id: "tension_combat_scaling"
  category: "tension"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "combat", "scaling"]
  content: |
    COMBAT SCALING for OP Protagonists:
    
    When power_imbalance > 10:
    - **REDUCE** combat frequency 50%
    - **INSTANT** resolution when PC engages ("Punch. Mist.")
    - **FOCUS** on aftermath, not mechanics
    - **SPECTACLE** over strategy
    
    Real session time goes to:
    - Social stakes
    - Existential crisis
    - Ensemble spotlight
    - Faction management (Overlord, Rimuru)
