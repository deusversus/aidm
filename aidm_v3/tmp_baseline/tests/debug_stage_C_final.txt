### 🏛️ The Threshold of the Forgotten

You steady your breathing, letting your senses expand outward. The world slows down, details sharpening into high-definition clarity like a camera lens finding focus.

The air here is old—tasting of ozone, damp stone, and crushed velvet.

Above you, the canopy of the **Ironwood Forest** breaks, allowing shafts of afternoon sunlight to pierce the gloom. They illuminate the dust motes dancing in the air, creating pillars of gold that strike the ruins before you.

> *Drip... drip...*

Water echoes from somewhere deep within the cavernous entrance. The structure isn't just a cave; it is the **Sunken Cathedral**, a relic of the Age of Gods, half-buried by centuries of earth and neglect.

Huge, moss-slicked statues of faceless angels line the path, their stone wings broken, pointing accusingly at the sky.

### 👁️ Critical Details

As you scan the perimeter, three things catch your eye, standing out against the background like interactable objects in a game:

1.  **The Warding Stone:** To your left, a weathered obelisk pulses with a faint, dying **azure light**. The protective magic is failing, flickering like a candle in a draft.
2.  **The Great Doors:** The massive bronze gates are not sealed. They stand slightly ajar—just enough for a human to slip through. Pitch blackness swirls beyond the gap.
3.  **The Anomaly:** Near the base of the stairs, the moss has been disturbed. **Fresh mud.** It looks like a boot print, heavy and recent. You aren't the first to arrive here today.

A chill wind blows from the open doors, ruffling your clothes and carrying a scent that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up: *dried blood and lavender.*

### 🎯 What Do You Do?

The entrance looms, silent and waiting.

- **Investigate the Footprint** — Analyze the tracks to gauge who (or what) is ahead of you.
- **Examine the Warding Stone** — Try to understand why the ancient seal is breaking.
- **Enter Stealthily** — Ignore the clues and slip into the darkness before you lose the element of surprise.
- **Call Out** — If someone is there, demand they show themselves.

*The choice is yours.*
