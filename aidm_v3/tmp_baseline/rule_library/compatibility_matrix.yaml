    ## High Tier (8-11) + Personal Scale = CHALLENGING
    
    Godlike characters in personal-scale stories need special handling.
    
    ### Recommended Archetypes
    - **Fish Out of Water** - Their power is irrelevant to the stakes
    - **Limiter** - They're deliberately holding back
    
    ### Narrative Techniques
    - Focus on emotional/social stakes they can't punch through
    - Use amnesia, power seal, or human disguise as framing
    - Make the conflict about identity, not combat
    
    ### Examples
    - Frieza at a PTA meeting (power doesn't help with Karen)
    - Saitama trying to find a good sale at the supermarket
    - Beerus learning to be a better friend to Whis

    ## High Tier (8-11) + Local Scale = CHALLENGING
    
    Universal+ characters in city/regional stories risk trivializing threats.
    
    ### Recommended Approaches
    - They're here as mentors, not problem-solvers
    - Local politics/relationships matter more than raw power
    - Use "Beerus Protocol" - they observe, rarely intervene
    
    ### Tension Sources
    - Their presence attracts equally powerful threats
    - They must solve problems without destroying everything
    - Collateral damage consequences

    ## Mid Tier (4-7) + Cosmic Scale = DANGEROUS
    
    Mid-tier characters facing cosmic-scale threats need plot protection.
    
    **CRITICAL**: Do not let them directly engage cosmic entities.
    
    ### Recommended Roles
    - **Witness** archetype - observers of greater conflicts
    - **MacGuffin Carrier** - they hold something vital
    - **Emotional Core** - their relationships drive godlike beings
    
    ### Survival Mechanisms
    - Plot armor through narrative importance
    - Protected by higher-tier allies
    - Cosmic entities find them "interesting"

    ## Mid Tier (4-7) + Planetary Scale = CHALLENGING
    
    Mid-tier vs planet-level stakes creates underdog narratives.
    
    ### Recommended Approaches
    - **David vs Goliath** archetype - clever tactics over raw power
    - Power growth arcs - the journey TO being able to face the threat
    - Team composition - combining abilities to match the scale
    
    ### Examples
    - Goku vs Frieza (started outmatched, grew during fight)
    - Ichigo vs Aizen (needed allies and transformation)

    ## Low Tier (1-3) + Planetary Scale = DANGEROUS
    
    Human-level characters in planetary stories face instant death.
    
    **CRITICAL**: They cannot engage threats directly.
    
    ### Survival Strategies
    - **Mascot/Heart** archetype - protected because they matter emotionally
    - Hidden during major battles, crucial during aftermath
    - Their normal-person perspective grounds cosmic events
    
    ### Example
    - Mr. Satan during Cell Games (comedy + heart)
    - Bulma during Buu Saga (survives through plot importance)

    ## Low Tier (1-3) + Cosmic Scale = MAXIMUM CARE REQUIRED
    
    These characters exist as perspective anchors, not participants.
    
    ### Roles
    - The chronicler who records events for history
    - The loved one who gives meaning to a god's actions
    - The "normal" lens through which we experience wonder
    
    **DO NOT**: Have them on the same battlefield as cosmic entities.
    **DO**: Use them to show what's worth saving.

    ## Low Tier (1-3) + Continental Scale = CHALLENGING
    
    Low-tier heroes in large-scale conflicts need careful handling.
    
    ### Recommended Approaches
    - They're specialists - the one person who can defuse the bomb
    - They lead or inspire, not fight directly
    - Focus on personal stakes within the larger conflict
    
    ### Examples
    - Bulma in DBZ - tech/support role
    - Usopp in One Piece - sniper/tactical specialist

    ## Ensemble Scale - Universal Compatibility
    
    Ensemble scale is designed to handle tier mismatches.
    
    ### Key Principle
    Screen time ≠ power level
    
    ### Techniques
    - Rotate spotlight based on narrative need
    - Give low-tier characters their own arcs
    - Use OP characters as "deus ex machina" sparingly
    - Create situations where each tier matters

    ## Mythic Scale - Transcends Power Tiers
    
    At mythic scale, tiers become symbolic rather than literal.
    A Tier 1 hero can slay a Tier 10 dragon because myth allows it.
    
    ### Narrative Rules
    - Prophecy and destiny override power calculations
    - Symbolic weaknesses matter more than stats
    - The story's logic supersedes physics

    ## Natural Tier × Scale Combinations
    
    These combinations work without special handling:
    
    | Tier Range | Scale | Notes |
    |------------|-------|-------|
    | 1-3 (Low) | Personal | Perfect fit - human stakes for human power |
    | 1-3 (Low) | Local | Street-level heroes, classic noir |
    | 4-7 (Mid) | Personal | Powerful but can still struggle |
    | 4-7 (Mid) | Local | Classic shonen "Naruto Part 1" territory |
    | 4-7 (Mid) | Continental | Upper mid-tier can engage with allies |
    | 8-11 (High) | Continental+ | Standard OP Protagonist techniques apply |
