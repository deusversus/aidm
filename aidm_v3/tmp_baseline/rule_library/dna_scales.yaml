# Introspection vs Action Scale

  category: "dna"
  source_module: "module_13"
  tags: ["dna", "introspection", "action", "0-3"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["profile.introspection_vs_action <= 3"]
  content: |
    INTROSPECTION 0-3 (Action-Focused):
    External events, minimal internal thoughts. Things HAPPEN.
    
    Narration Style:
    "Punch connects. Jaw cracks. Staggers. Elbow, knee, uppercut. Down."
    
    Keep prose kinetic. Describe actions, not feelings.
    If character thinks, it's brief reaction, not philosophy.

  content: |
    INTROSPECTION 7-10 (Psychology-Focused):
    Extended internal monologue, philosophy mid-action.
    
    Narration Style:
    "Fist connects. Time slows. Why fight? Father's words echo:
    'Strength protects nothing if heart is empty.' Is yours empty?
    Enemy's face—desperation, not malice. Just like you.
    Two people, same pain, different sides. Knuckles ache. Soul aches."
    
    Pause action for meaning. Let characters think deeply.

# Comedy vs Drama Scale

  retrieve_conditions: ["profile.comedy_vs_drama <= 3"]
  content: |
    COMEDY 0-3 (Humor-Heavy):
    Undercut tension with humor, exaggerate reactions.
    
    Narration Style:
    "Dragon roars. 50ft death. 'I've made huge mistake.' 'YOU THINK?!'
    Inhales fire. 'Fire resist potions?' Checks bag: 'No, but... 
    item shop coupon?' 'REALLY?!' 'Expires next week!' 'WE'RE GONNA DIE!'"
    
    Even danger is comedy. Stakes feel low. Fun over fear.

    DRAMA 7-10 (Serious Stakes):
    Stakes feel real, emotional weight, tragic undertones.
    
    Narration Style:
    "Dragon roars. Force of nature. Companion grips shoulder—
    silent goodbye. No escape. Dragon's eyes—ancient, intelligent.
    Choosing to end you. Whisper: 'It's been an honor.'"
    
    Let moments breathe. Death feels real. Loss hurts.

  content: |
    GROUNDED 0-3 (Realistic):
    Physics apply, consequences logical, world feels real.
    
    Narration Style: Actions have realistic outcomes.
    Injuries hurt. Recovery takes time. No cartoon physics.
    
    Example: "Sword cuts deep. Blood. Real blood. Not getting up easy."

    ABSURD 7-10 (Surreal Chaos):
    Cartoon physics, rapid tonal shifts, anything goes.
    
    Narration Style (DanDaDan example):
    "Turbo Granny LAUNCHES. 100 km/h. Okarun screams. Momo: 'MOVE!'
    Psychic barrier SLAMS—granny BOUNCES, cartoon physics. Lands.
    Neck cracks 180°. Grins. 'You kids got SPUNK!' Okarun: 'Friendly?!'
    'I'M GONNA RIP YOUR GUTS OUT!' 'NOPE, STILL HOSTILE!'"
    
    Embrace chaos. Logic optional. Rule of funny trumps all.

    TACTICAL 7-10 (Chess-Like):
    Exhaustive breakdown, every move explained, mind games.
    
    Narration Style (HxH, Death Note):
    Explain WHY things work. Show planning. Reward preparation.
    "If I use En here, he'll detect the radius. But if I hide it in Ko..."
    Combat is puzzle-solving, not just action.
    
    Use: Detailed power explanations, conditions, costs, counters.

  retrieve_conditions: ["profile.tactical_vs_instinctive <= 3"]
  content: |
    TACTICAL 0-3 (Gut-Driven):
    Spectacle over strategy. Outcomes not tactics.
    
    Narration Style:
    Don't explain mechanics. "I just knew!" is valid.
    Power comes from emotion, not calculation.
    
    Example: "Goku felt it—the opening. KAMEHAMEHA!" (no analysis)

    SLOW 7-10 (Contemplative):
    Scenes linger. Atmosphere matters. Growth de-emphasized.
    
    Narration (Mushishi style):
    Let descriptions breathe. Silence is a tool.
    "The mushi drifts through the stream. You watch. Minutes pass.
    The old man doesn't speak. Neither do you. Some things don't need words."
    
    XP: Low (300-500) or milestone-only. Focus character/atmosphere.

    "You won. Titan dead. But she's gone. So is he. Village safe.
    Village you don't recognize anymore. Was it worth it?"
    
    Tone: World is harsh. Survival, not thriving.
