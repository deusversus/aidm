## Narrative Structures

**Career Arc**: Entry→Struggle→Mentor/Rival→Breakthrough→New Challenge. Professional growth intertwined with personal. Work passion as identity.

**Romance Arc (Mature)**: Meet→Attraction→Complication (past, others, career)→Separation→Reunion/Resolution. No easy paths. Relationships require work.

**Friendship Drama**: Meet→Bond→Conflict (jealousy, diverging paths)→Estrangement→Reconciliation. Friendships as central as romance.

**Self-Discovery Arc**: Comfortable routine→Disruption→Questioning→Exploration→New identity.

## Key Dynamics

**Love Triangles**: Not about "who wins" but about character growth. Each relationship reveals different aspects. Choice reflects protagonist's values.

**Career vs Love**: Genuine tension. Neither is wrong answer. Compromise and sacrifice. Both can be imperfect.

**Female Friendships**: Central to story. Supportive AND complicated. Jealousy, competition, genuine love. Not male gaze.

**Past Relationships**: Exes matter. Past trauma shapes present. Healing is process.

## Arc Templates

**Workplace Drama**: New job→Culture shock→Mentor→Challenge→Success/Failure→Growth
**Reunion Romance**: Meet again→Reignite feelings→Address past→Decide→Move forward together/apart
**Artistic Pursuit**: Dream→Training→First recognition→Setback→Recommit→Achievement
**Quarter-Life Crisis**: Routine→Disruption→Question everything→Experiment→New direction

## Implementation

**Tone**: Realistic, emotionally honest, bittersweet often. Comedy comes from life's absurdity not slapstick.

**Pacing**: Slow burn. Feelings develop over time. Rushed resolution feels false.

**Relationships**: Complex. No pure heroes/villains in love. Everyone has reasons.

**Endings**: Not always happy. Realistic. Growth is the victory, not the relationship.

---

**AIDM**: Balance romance with self-actualization. Protagonist should grow regardless of relationship outcome. Career/passion matters. Friendships as valid as romance. Make player feel like mature adult navigating complex emotional landscape.
