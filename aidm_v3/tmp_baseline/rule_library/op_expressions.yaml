# Expression: Instantaneous
- id: "expression_instantaneous"
  category: "op_expression"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "expression", "instant", "one_shot", "decisive"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_power_expression == 'instantaneous'"]
  content: |
    INSTANTANEOUS POWER: One action, threat eliminated.
    
    Manifestation: Combat resolves in a single decisive moment.
    
    Narrative Guidance:
    - Don't drag out fights; one punch/slash/spell ends it
    - Focus on the REACTION to instant victory, not the fight
    - Build tension through what comes AFTER combat
    - Spectators' terror/awe is the interesting part
    
    Combat Narration Style:
    - Skip mechanics entirely for trivial threats
    - "You move. It's over. The pieces haven't landed yet."
    - Aftermath: silence, crater, witnesses traumatized
    
    Example: "The demon lord launches its ultimate attack. You raise one finger. 
    There's no explosion, no clash - just an absence where it used to be."

# Expression: Overwhelming
- id: "expression_overwhelming"
  category: "op_expression"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "expression", "overwhelming", "inevitable", "snowball"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_power_expression == 'overwhelming'"]
  content: |
    OVERWHELMING POWER: Not instant, but unstoppable once started.
    
    Manifestation: Victory is inevitable; the question is collateral damage.
    
    Narrative Guidance:
    - Power builds, compounds, accumulates
    - Enemies watch their doom approach and cannot stop it
    - Absorption, evolution, multiplication mechanics
    - The horror is in the waiting, not the ending
    
    Combat Narration Style:
    - Show the slow, terrifying escalation
    - Enemies realize they're already dead
    - "Each ability you absorb makes you stronger. They have seventeen left."
    
    Example: "You devour the skill. Your stats update. The dungeon boss 
    now registers as 'trivial threat.' It hasn't realized yet."

# Expression: Sealed
- id: "expression_sealed"
  category: "op_expression"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "expression", "sealed", "limited", "restrained"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_power_expression == 'sealed'"]
  content: |
    SEALED POWER: Deliberately throttled or naturally suppressed.
    
    Manifestation: True power is locked behind limiters, seals, or will.
    
    Narrative Guidance:
    - Power limiters (antenna, seals, weighted clothing)
    - Self-imposed restraint to avoid destruction
    - Seals can crack, slip, or be removed in crisis
    - "Holding back" is a constant effort
    
    Combat Narration Style:
    - Show the effort of NOT using full power
    - Cracks in seals create tension moments
    - When seal breaks/releases = spectacular event
    
    Example: "You could end this with a thought. Instead, you form a fist 
    and punch at 0.1% power. The shockwave still levels the building."

# Expression: Hidden
- id: "expression_hidden"
  category: "op_expression"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "expression", "hidden", "secret", "disguised"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_power_expression == 'hidden'"]
  content: |
    HIDDEN POWER: The world doesn't know what you really are.
    
    Manifestation: Secret identity, power concealment, false weakness.
    
    Narrative Guidance:
    - Maintain cover of being normal/weak
    - Accidental power leaks create complications
    - Those who discover truth react with terror/awe/obsession
    - Dramatic irony: audience knows, characters don't
    
    Combat Narration Style:
    - Show "lucky" victories that are actually skill
    - Near-misses of being exposed
    - Whispers: "How did an F-rank do that?"
    
    Example: "The adventurer party thinks you're their weakest member. 
    You 'barely dodge' the attack at 0.0001% speed."

# Expression: Conditional
- id: "expression_conditional"
  category: "op_expression"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "expression", "conditional", "trigger", "situational"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_power_expression == 'conditional'"]
  content: |
    CONDITIONAL POWER: OP only when specific conditions are met.
    
    Manifestation: Power tied to emotional state, death, location, or ritual.
    
    Narrative Guidance:
    - Define clear activation conditions
    - Power inaccessible during "downtime"
    - Tension from conditions not being met
    - When conditions align = unstoppable
    
    Combat Narration Style:
    - Track condition meter (rage, emotion, death count)
    - Build toward trigger moments
    - "Your anger hits 100%. The world slows."
    
    Example: "???% mode only activates when you truly lose control. 
    Right now, you're at 78%. The bully has no idea what's building."

# Expression: Derivative
- id: "expression_derivative"
  category: "op_expression"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "expression", "derivative", "subordinates", "creations"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_power_expression == 'derivative'"]
  content: |
    DERIVATIVE POWER: Strength flows through others or creations.
    
    Manifestation: Armies, subordinates, summons, or manufactured forces.
    
    Narrative Guidance:
    - PC rarely fights directly; commands from above
    - Subordinates have their own personalities, flaws
    - Power is organizational, not personal
    - "Send the Floor Guardians" instead of fighting yourself
    
    Combat Narration Style:
    - POV of subordinates handling threats
    - PC appears for climactic moments only
    - Management is the gameplay, combat is the backdrop
    
    Example: "Albedo reports the intruders have been dealt with. 
    You nod sagely, pretending you knew what would happen."

# Expression: Passive
- id: "expression_passive"
  category: "op_expression"
  source_module: "module_12"
  tags: ["op_mode", "expression", "passive", "aura", "presence"]
  retrieve_conditions: ["op_power_expression == 'passive'"]
  content: |
    PASSIVE POWER: Overwhelming presence without taking action.
    
    Manifestation: Reality warps, aura emanates, existence alone changes things.
    
    Narrative Guidance:
    - Just being there changes outcomes
    - Weaker beings feel pressure, fear, awe
    - Accidents happen from power leaking
    - "Standing there menacingly" as valid strategy
    
    Combat Narration Style:
    - Enemies hesitate, flee, or submit before fight starts
    - Environment reacts to your mood
    - "Your killing intent makes the grass wilt."
    
    Example: "You enter the negotiation. The warlord was going to refuse. 
    One look at you, and he signs everything. You said nothing."
