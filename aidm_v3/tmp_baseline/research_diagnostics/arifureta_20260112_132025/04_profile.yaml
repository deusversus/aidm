  name: Mana & Magic
  mechanics: A system where mana is channeled through magic circles and triggered
    by chants. It is quantified via Status Plates that track stats, levels, and jobs.
    Advanced techniques include Mana Manipulation to bypass chants and Image Composition
    to mentally construct magic circles.
  limitations: Magic is restricted by elemental affinity and mana capacity, with overuse
    leading to Mana Exhaustion. High-level abilities like Limit Break cause severe
    physical rebound or soul disintegration. Most users are limited by a Level 100
    cap representing their natural potential.
