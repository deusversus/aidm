## Locations
The world of **Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest** is primarily set in the world of **Tortus**, one of nine alternate realities branching from a root world known as **True World Astral**. 

Tortus is a high-fantasy world governed by the influence of a self-proclaimed god, **Ehit**, and is divided by geography, race, and the legendary **Seven Great Labyrinths**.

---

### **1. World Geography & Major Regions**
Tortus is divided into two primary landmasses separated by a vast ocean, with distinct regions housing the three main races: Humans, Beastmen, and Demons.

*   **The Northern Continent:** The largest inhabited landmass, primarily ruled by humans.
    *   **Heiligh Kingdom:** The most powerful human nation and the center of the Holy Church of Ehit. Its capital is **Fuhren**. It is the location where the protagonists were initially summoned.
    *   **Hoelscher Empire:** A militaristic human nation located to the west of Heiligh. It is known for its aggressive expansion and reliance on slavery.
    *   **The Sea of Trees (Haltina):** Located on the far eastern edge of the northern continent. It is a massive, fog-shrouded forest that serves as the home of the **Beastmen** and their hidden capital, **Verbergen**.
    *   **Northern Mountain Range:** A vast, frozen range at the northernmost tip of the continent. It houses the **Divine Mountain**, the headquarters of the Holy Church.
*   **The Southern Continent:** Separated from the north by the "Sea of Mirages."
    *   **Garland (The Demon Kingdom):** The primary territory of the **Demons**. It is a harsh, dark land where the demons have built a powerful civilization under their King.
*   **Neutral & Independent Territories:**
    *   **Independent Merchant Republic of Fuhren:** A major hub for trade and the Adventurer's Guild.
    *   **Coastal City of Erisen:** Located on the western coast, it is the home of the **Sea People** (Dagon race) and is built over the ocean.
    *   **Gruen Desert:** A massive desert in the central-west region, home to the **Dukedom of Ankaji**.

---

### **3. Other Significant Worlds**
While Tortus is the main setting, the series eventually introduces other worlds within the *Arifureta* multiverse:
*   **Earth:** Hajime’s original world (modern Japan).
*   **Sky Dragon World:** A world where people live on floating islands.
*   **Desert World:** A world of endless sand and giant insects.
*   **Hell:** A world inhabited by mechanical lifeforms and "monsters" that Hajime visits in the *After Story*.

### **4. Key Landmarks**
*   **The Divine Mountain (Holy Church HQ):** A massive peak where the "God" Ehit supposedly resides. It is the religious heart of the human world.
*   **Reisen Gorge:** A massive canyon that splits the land, characterized by a unique atmospheric phenomenon that negates magic.
*   **Lake Town of Ur:** A peaceful town near the Northern Mountain Range, famous for its scenery and the site of a major battle against a monster horde.

## Characters
In the series *Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest*, the story centers on a group of high school students summoned to the world of Tortus. The narrative follows the transformation of the protagonist from a weak "incompetent" into a ruthless, god-slaying warrior.

### **Protagonist: Hajime Nagumo**
*   **Role:** The main protagonist. Initially a kind-hearted, weak "Synergist," he becomes a cold, pragmatic anti-hero after being betrayed by a classmate and left for dead in the abyss of the Orcus Labyrinth.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Transmutation (Synergy):** Originally a mundane crafting skill, he evolves it to manipulate matter at a molecular level.
    *   **Demonic Mutation:** By consuming monster meat and surviving its toxic effects, he gained superhuman strength, speed, and durability, breaking the world's level 100 limit.
    *   **Gunsmithing & Artifact Creation:** He uses Earth's scientific knowledge to create modern weaponry (revolvers like *Donner* and *Schlag*, sniper rifles, and even vehicles) and magical artifacts.
    *   **Ancient Magic:** He eventually masters all seven types of Ancient Magic, including Gravity, Spatial, and Soul magic.
*   **Relationships:** He is the leader of his party and eventually enters a polygamous marriage with his primary companions. He is also a doting father to his adopted daughter, **Myu**.

---

### **Main Heroines (The Party)**

#### **1. Yue**
*   **Role:** The primary heroine and a Vampire Princess who was imprisoned for 300 years. She is Hajime’s first companion and the emotional anchor that keeps him from losing his humanity.
*   **Abilities:** High-speed regeneration, magical prodigy (mastery over all elements), and the ability to use Ancient Magic without chants.
*   **Relationships:** Hajime’s "first and official wife." She shares a deep, unbreakable bond with him and acts as a mentor to the other girls.

#### **2. Shea Haulia**
*   **Role:** A rabbit-girl (Beastman) who was cast out of her tribe. She provides the group with optimism and emotional warmth.
*   **Abilities:** **Future Sight** (Divination) and **Body Strengthening**. Unlike other beastmen, she can use mana to increase her physical power to monstrous levels. She wields a massive warhammer named *Drucken*.
*   **Relationships:** One of Hajime's wives. She has a sister-like bond with Yue and is often the "heart" of the group.

#### **3. Tio Klarus**
*   **Role:** A princess of the Dragonmen tribe. Despite her noble background, she is a massive masochist who finds pleasure in Hajime’s harsh treatment.
*   **Abilities:** Can transform into a massive black dragon. She is a master of wind and fire magic and possesses immense physical durability.
*   **Relationships:** One of Hajime's wives. She acts as the "wise elder" of the group due to her 500+ years of experience.

#### **4. Kaori Shirasaki**
*   **Role:** Hajime’s classmate and the "class idol" who loved him even before their summoning.
*   **Abilities:** Initially a high-level **Healer**. After being killed and revived, her soul is transferred into the body of an **Apostle (Noint)**, granting her superhuman combat stats, wings, and twin swords.
*   **Relationships:** One of Hajime's wives and Yue’s primary "love rival." She is best friends with Shizuku Yaegashi.

---

### **Antagonists**

#### **Main Antagonist: Ehit (The False God)**
*   **Role:** The creator and "God" of Tortus. He views the world as a game board and manipulates the races (Humans, Demons, and Beastmen) into perpetual war for his own amusement.
*   **Motivations:** He seeks a powerful vessel (specifically Yue) to possess so he can descend into the physical world and continue his "games" on a larger scale, eventually targeting Earth.
*   **Abilities:** Near-omnipotence within Tortus, control over "God's Apostles," and mastery of all Ancient Magics.

#### **Secondary Antagonists**
*   **Daisuke Hiyama:** A classmate and bully who betrayed Hajime in the labyrinth out of jealousy over Kaori. He later aligns with the demons and Ehit.
*   **Eri Nakamura:** A classmate who appears kind but is actually a sociopathic necromancer. She betrays the Hero Party to "claim" Kouki Amanogawa for herself by turning him into an undead puppet.
*   **Freid Bagwa:** A powerful demon commander who serves Ehit. He views Hajime as a "heretic" and a threat to his god's plans.

---

### **Key Supporting Characters**
*   **Shizuku Yaegashi:** Kaori’s best friend and a master swordswoman. She eventually joins Hajime’s party and becomes one of his wives.
*   **Kouki Amanogawa:** The "Hero" of the summoned class. He struggles with a naive sense of justice and becomes a foil to Hajime’s pragmatism, eventually falling into a brief period of corruption.
*   **Aiko Hatayama:** The students' teacher. She is a "Soul Foodist" who can manipulate agriculture. She is one of the few who challenges the Holy Church's authority and eventually becomes one of Hajime's wives.

## Combat
Combat in *Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest* is defined by a stark contrast between gritty, survivalist pragmatism and high-fantasy "flashy spectacle." The series transitions from the protagonist’s desperate, tactical struggle for survival in the abyss to a display of overwhelming, techno-magical dominance.

### **1. Fighting Styles & Tactical Combat**
The combat system revolves around "Jobs" and "Skills," but the protagonist, **Hajime Nagumo**, breaks this system through **Transmutation** and **monster consumption**.

*   **Hajime’s "Gun-Kata" & CQC:** Hajime utilizes a self-taught, highly efficient fighting style that blends superhuman physical prowess with modern firearms. He uses kicks and elbow-strikes (often augmented by built-in shotguns in his prosthetic arm) to create openings for his revolvers, **Donner and Schlag**.
*   **Tactical Ingenuity:** Unlike traditional heroes who rely on "heart," Hajime wins through preparation and exploitation of physics. 
    *   **Environmental Manipulation:** He uses Transmutation to instantly create pitfalls, barricades, or spikes.
    *   **Resourcefulness:** Early in the series, he created flashbangs from "Green Light Stones" and used "Blast Rock" as gunpowder.
    *   **The "Railgun" Principle:** He uses his **Lightning Field** skill to electrically accelerate specially crafted ore bullets, giving his handguns the stopping power of anti-tank rifles.
*   **Party Synergy:**
    *   **Yue (Vampire):** A magical prodigy who provides high-output elemental and Ancient Magic support. She often acts as the "artillery" while Hajime handles the "front-line."
    *   **Shea Haulia (Beastman):** Uses a massive war hammer, **Drucken**, and "Future Sight" to act as a heavy hitter. Her style is "bulldozing"—relying on raw strength and gravity manipulation.
    *   **Tio Klarus (Dragonborn):** Provides aerial superiority and massive breath attacks in dragon form, while using "Pain-to-Power" conversion (Masochism) to buff her stats.
    *   **Shizuku Yaegashi:** Represents traditional martial arts. Her style is refined, graceful, and focused on "one-hit-kill" sword techniques using her black blade.

### **2. Flashy Spectacle & Ancient Magic**
As the series progresses, battles scale from dungeon crawls to "God-slaying" spectacles involving orbital weaponry and reality-warping magic.

*   **Ancient Magic (Age of Gods):** These are the pinnacle of the magic system, allowing users to manipulate fundamental laws:
    *   **Gravity Magic:** Used to crush armies or increase the weight of weapons like Shea’s hammer.
    *   **Spatial Magic:** Allows for teleportation, creating pocket dimensions, or "Riftwalking" through enemy defenses.
    *   **Creation Magic:** The core of Hajime’s power, allowing him to imbue artifacts with magical properties.
*   **Techno-Magical Artillery:** Hajime’s arsenal provides the "spectacle."
    *   **Hyperion:** An orbital satellite laser that focuses sunlight into a devastating pillar of heat.
    *   **Cross Bits:** Small, autonomous drones that provide 360-degree offense and defense, turning a duel into a bullet-hell scenario.
    *   **Schlagen:** A massive anti-material railgun capable of decapitating dragons from kilometers away.

### **3. Emotional Weight & Stakes**
The emotional core of *Arifureta’s* combat is the trauma of **betrayal** and the **will to survive**.

*   **The Abyss Mentality:** Hajime’s combat is fueled by a "kill or be killed" philosophy born from his time in the Orcus Labyrinth. His lack of mercy often shocks his former classmates, creating emotional friction between his pragmatism and their idealism.
*   **Protecting the "Family":** While Hajime claims to be cold, his most intense battles (like the fight against the Apostle **Noint**) are driven by the need to protect his companions. His "bottomless rage" becomes a literal power source in the final arc.
*   **Ideological Clashes:** Battles against characters like **Kouki Amanogawa** (the "Hero") are less about physical strength and more about the deconstruction of the "chosen one" trope. Hajime’s victory represents the triumph of self-made power over "blessed" destiny.

### **4. Key Spectacle Battles**
*   **Hajime vs. Noint:** A high-speed aerial duel. Noint uses thousands of feathers as decoys and magic circles, while Hajime uses shotgun-propelled somersaults and Cross Bits to counter her. It concludes with a brutal display of Hajime’s "Diamond Skin" and a point-blank execution.
*   **The Final Battle vs. Ehit:** A cosmic-scale conflict where Hajime uses **Concept Magic** ("Returning the Agony You Spread"). The battle involves Ehit transforming into a grotesque "meat lump" of fused monsters and Hajime unleashing his entire arsenal—from Gatling guns to satellite lasers—to literally erase a god from existence.

## Power System
The power system in *Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest* is a hybrid of traditional RPG mechanics (stats, levels, jobs) and a deep, lore-driven magical hierarchy. Unlike many "isekai" series, the system is grounded in the world's physics and the influence of a "God" who treats the world as a game.

### **1. Core Mechanics: Mana and Stats**
*   **Mana (Magic Power):** The primary energy source, which is the planet’s life force given form. 
    *   **Mana Conversion:** Mana can be converted into various forms of energy, such as kinetic (strength), stamina, or healing.
    *   **Mana Manipulation:** Most inhabitants require **Magic Circles** and **Incantations** to use mana. Only "Atavists" or those with specific skills (like Hajime) can manipulate mana directly.
*   **Status Plates:** These are silver rectangular artifacts that quantify a person’s abilities. They display:
    *   **Level:** A numerical representation of how much of a person's latent potential has been unlocked.
    *   **Stats:** Strength, Vitality, Defense, Agility, Magic, and Magic Defense.
    *   **Job:** A person’s "vocation" or class (e.g., Synergist, Hero, Healer), which dictates their growth rates and available skills.

### **2. Progression and Rules**
*   **Stat-Driven Leveling:** In a reversal of standard RPG tropes, **stats determine the level**. A person only "levels up" after their physical and magical attributes increase through training or combat.
*   **The Level 100 Cap:** For normal humans, Level 100 is the absolute limit of their potential. Once reached, no amount of training will increase their stats further.
*   **Skill Acquisition:** Skills are typically learned through rigorous training or are inherent to a Job. 
    *   **Hajime’s Exception:** By consuming monster meat and surviving the resulting mutation (aided by **Ambrosia**, a high-density mana liquid), Hajime gained the ability to absorb monster skills directly, a feat normally impossible for humans.

### **3. The Magic Hierarchy**
Magic is divided into three distinct tiers based on complexity and power:

| Tier | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Modern Magic** | Elemental magic (Fire, Water, Wind, etc.) used by most mages. Requires chants and circles. |
| **Mid** | **Ancient Magic** | Seven "Age of Gods" magics that govern universal laws (Creation, Gravity, Space, Time, Soul, Information, Organic Matter). |
| **High** | **Concept Magic** | The pinnacle of power. It allows the user to overwrite the laws of reality by imbuing a "concept" (a powerful desire or will) into the world. |

#### **The Seven Ancient Magics:**
1.  **Creation:** Manipulates inorganic matter; used to create **Artifacts**.
2.  **Gravity:** Controls gravitational forces and planetary energy.
3.  **Spatial:** Manipulates boundaries and dimensions (teleportation, barriers).
4.  **Restoration:** Manipulates time to return objects/beings to a previous state.
5.  **Spirit:** Directly interferes with the soul, memories, and consciousness.
6.  **Evolution:** Manipulates information to enhance or evolve existing abilities/stats.
7.  **Metamorphosis:** Manipulates organic matter and can transform living beings.

### **4. Power Tiers**
Character strength is often categorized into tiers based on their ability to interact with the world's fundamental laws:
*   **Tier 1 (God-Like):** Hajime Nagumo and Yue. They possess all seven Ancient Magics and can use Concept Magic. Hajime’s stats are "???" because they exceed the Status Plate's capacity (surpassing 10,000+ while the average hero is around 1,500).
*   **Tier 2 (High-Human/Monster):** Shea Haulia, Tio Klarus, and Kaori Shirasaki. They possess massive mana pools and specialized Ancient Magics or unique racial traits (e.g., Shea’s Future Sight).
*   **Tier 3 (Elite/Hero):** The Hero Party (Kouki, Shizuku, etc.). They have high stats (600–1,500) and specialized combat jobs but are limited by the standard leveling system.
*   **Tier 4 (Average):** Standard soldiers and mages. Stats range from 100 to 400.

### **5. Limitations and Weaknesses**
*   **Mana Overload:** If a person absorbs too much mana without a way to regulate it, it can be fatal.
*   **Affinity Restrictions:** Most people are born with an affinity for only one or two elements. Attempting to use magic outside of one's affinity is highly inefficient and often impossible.
*   **Physical Rebound:** High-tier skills like **Limit Break** (which triples stats) cause extreme physical strain and fatigue once the duration ends.
*   **The "God's Game":** The entire power system was designed by the god **Ehit** to ensure that no inhabitant could ever become strong enough to challenge him, making Hajime's "irregular" progression a direct threat to the world's order.

## Tone
**Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest** is a series known for its dramatic tonal shifts and its "edgy" take on the isekai genre. Originally a web novel by Ryo Shirakome, it has been adapted into a light novel, manga, and anime.

### **1. Tone: The "Edgy" Shift**
The tone of *Arifureta* is famously split into two distinct phases:
*   **Initial Tone (Dark & Gritty):** The story begins with a heavy, survival-horror tone. After being betrayed and left for dead in a lethal dungeon, the protagonist, Hajime, undergoes a brutal transformation. This phase is defined by physical agony, psychological trauma, and a "kill or be killed" mentality.
*   **Later Tone (Action-Comedy/Harem):** Once Hajime escapes the initial abyss, the tone shifts toward a high-octane power fantasy. It becomes more light-hearted, incorporating slapstick humor, harem antics, and over-the-top action. While the "edginess" remains in Hajime’s personality, the surrounding world becomes more colorful and less oppressive.

### **2. Themes**
*   **Betrayal and Resilience:** The catalyst for the story is a classmate’s betrayal. The series explores how such a trauma can strip away a person's kindness, leaving only the raw will to survive.
*   **Transformation:** This is both physical (Hajime’s hair turning white, gaining a muscular build) and psychological (from a timid otaku to a cold, efficient warrior).
*   **Self-Interest vs. Heroism:** Hajime explicitly rejects the "Hero" role forced upon his classmates. His primary theme is "I will do whatever it takes to go home," often contrasting his pragmatism with the naive idealism of the "Hero" party.
*   **Commonplace to World's Strongest:** The central underdog theme—taking a "useless" skill (Synergy/Transmutation) and using creativity and modern knowledge to surpass "god-tier" abilities.

### **3. Dark Comedy**
*Arifureta* frequently uses **dark comedy** to poke fun at its own "edgelord" tropes. 
*   **Chuunibyou Satire:** The author is aware that Hajime’s black-clad, gun-toting persona is "cringe" by real-world standards. Characters like Yue often tease him for his "edgy" choices in clothing or weapon names.
*   **Absurdist Humor:** Much of the comedy comes from the juxtaposition of Hajime’s serious, lethal nature with the eccentricities of his harem (e.g., a perverted dragon, a hyperactive bunny girl).
*   **Isekai Tropes:** It parodies typical isekai conventions by having the protagonist treat the "destined quest" as a nuisance and the "Hero" as an incompetent child.

### **4. Optimism vs. Pessimism**
While the series is often labeled as cynical, it contains a core of **relentless optimism** through Hajime’s goal.
*   **The Will to Return:** Despite being in a world that hates him, Hajime’s absolute belief that he *will* return to Earth serves as the story's hopeful anchor.
*   **Found Family:** The optimism is also found in the bonds Hajime forms. He starts as a loner who trusts no one, but eventually builds a loyal "family" of outcasts who find happiness despite the world’s hostility.

### **5. Atmosphere, Genre, and Mood**
*   **Genre:** A hybrid of **Isekai, Dark Fantasy, Action-Adventure, and Harem**. It also contains strong **Sci-Fi/Mecha** elements, as Hajime uses magic to create modern technology like revolvers, sniper rifles, motorcycles, and even orbital lasers.
*   **Atmosphere:** 
    *   *Dungeon Phase:* Claustrophobic, terrifying, and visceral.
    *   *Surface Phase:* Adventurous, chaotic, and often absurd.
*   **Mood:** The mood is **cynical yet empowering**. It caters to the "revenge fantasy" itch while maintaining a sense of fun through its increasingly ridiculous power scaling and character interactions.

### **Comparison Across Mediums**
*   **Light Novel:** Offers the most balanced experience, with deep psychological monologues and a clear distinction between the serious and comedic moments.
*   **Manga:** Leans more heavily into the **comedy and expressive character reactions**, making the "edgy" parts feel more like a stylistic choice.
*   **Anime:** Often criticized for rushing the dark introductory phase and relying on poor CGI, which can unintentionally make the serious moments feel like "accidental comedy."

## Factions
In the world of *Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest*, the geopolitical landscape is defined by a conflict between three primary races (Humans, Demons, and Beastmen) and the manipulative influence of a false god. 

### **1. Major World Powers (Nations)**
The continent of Tortus is divided into several major sovereign entities:

*   **Heiligh Kingdom:** The oldest human nation, located in the northwest. It is a traditional monarchy deeply intertwined with the **Holy Church**. It served as the initial base for the summoned heroes. After its destruction during the demon invasion, it was rebuilt as a more inclusive nation.
*   **Hoelscher Empire:** A meritocratic human nation in the east that values strength above all else. Historically, it was the primary antagonist to the beastmen, frequently hunting them for the **slave trade**. Following Hajime's intervention, the Empire was forced to abolish slavery and sign a peace treaty with Verbergen.
*   **Verbergen:** The unified nation of beastmen located deep within the **Sea of Trees**. It is governed by a **Council of Elders** representing various tribes (Bearmen, Tigermen, etc.). They are reclusive and protective of their territory, which is naturally shielded by a magical mist.
*   **Garland Demon Kingdom:** Located in the southern half of the continent. The demons possess higher magical affinity than humans and have been at war with humanity for centuries. They were manipulated by Ehit to believe they were the "chosen" race to replace humans.
*   **Free Cities of Erisen:** A maritime city-state inhabited by the **Dagons** (merfolk). It is a neutral mercantile hub that provides the majority of the continent's seafood. Because of their economic importance, even the human nations generally respect their autonomy.

---

### **2. Key Organizations & Factions**
*   **The Church of Ehit:** The dominant religious organization in Tortus. While appearing benevolent, its true purpose is to manipulate the mortal races into perpetual war for the amusement of the god **Ehit**. Its hierarchy includes the Pope (Ishtar Langbard), Cardinals, and Templar Knights.
*   **The Liberators:** An ancient organization of "Mavericks" who discovered the truth about Ehit thousands of years ago. They created the **Seven Great Labyrinths** to hide their "Age of Gods" magic and test future generations who might be strong enough to kill Ehit.
*   **Hajime’s Party (The Irregulars):** A small but world-shattering group led by Hajime Nagumo. Members include **Yue** (Vampire Princess), **Shea Haulia** (Rabbitman), **Tio Klarus** (Dragonman), and **Kaori Shirasaki**. They operate independently of any nation's laws.
*   **The Hero Party:** The group of 32 students and their teacher summoned from Earth. Initially led by **Kouki Amanogawa**, they were intended to be pawns for the Church. Over time, the group fractured due to betrayals and differing ideologies.
*   **The Haulia Tribe:** Originally the weakest tribe of rabbitmen, they were transformed by Hajime’s "hellish training" into a feared unit of guerrilla warfare specialists and assassins. They eventually became the official ambassadors for Verbergen.
*   **The Returnees:** A group formed in the *After Story* consisting of the students who successfully returned to Earth. They are led by Hajime and protected by a special division of the Japanese government.

### **3. Racial Factions**
*   **Apostles of God:** Artificial beings created by Ehit to maintain his "game board." They are silver-haired, winged warriors (like **Noint**) with immense power and no free will, serving as the ultimate enforcers of the Church.
*   **Dragonmen (Klarus Clan):** A near-extinct race that can transform into dragons. They lived in a hidden village for 500 years after being branded as heretics by Ehit. They consider themselves the "Guardians of the World."
*   **Vampires:** A race nearly wiped out by the Church centuries ago. Yue is the last known royal survivor. They possess high magical power and the ability to regenerate.

### **4. Alliances & Enemies**
#### **Primary Alliances**
*   **The Allied Forces of Tortus:** During the final "Ragnarok" battle, the Kingdom, Empire, Verbergen, Erisen, and the Dragonmen formed a historic alliance to overthrow Ehit and his Apostle army.
*   **Hajime and the Haulia:** A deep blood-pact where the Haulia serve as Hajime’s "shadow" in exchange for his protection and training.

#### **Major Enemies**
*   **Ehit (Ehitruje):** The primary antagonist; a "false god" from another world who treats Tortus as a game.
*   **Freid Bagwa:** The Supreme Commander of the Demon Army. A devout worshipper of his god (Alva/Ehit), he viewed Hajime as his greatest rival.
*   **Eri Nakamura:** A traitor among the summoned students who sided with the demons. She used necromancy to turn the Heiligh Kingdom's knights into an undead army.
*   **Daisuke Hiyama:** The student who initially betrayed Hajime. He later allied with the demons and the Church out of jealousy and obsession with Kaori.
*   **Omnibus (After Story):** A secret Vatican-linked organization on Earth that initially views the Returnees as a threat before becoming an uneasy ally against demons from "Hell."
