## Code Change Rules

1. **NEVER make code changes without explicit user permission.** After research/debugging, present findings and ASK before implementing fixes.

2. **Test scripts are OK** - Creating test/debug scripts to investigate issues is allowed without asking.

3. **Plans require approval** - Always get approval on implementation_plan.md before execution.
