Deus breathes in, the air around him freezing into absolute stillness. He raises the vibrating crystalline shard to eye level, not to use it as a tool, but to calibrate his own senses. He engages what he believes to be a simple, fundamental drill: **Basic Observation**.

His pupils contract to pinpoints.

*Zzzzt.*

The sound isn't physical; it is the high-pitched whine of reality's texture failing to render under the weight of his scrutiny.

In a wash of kinetic distortion, the saturation drains from the Utz marketplace. The bustling stalls, the awestruck farmer, the cobblestones—they don't disappear, they become **glass**. The opacity of the material world is stripped away, leaving only wireframe outlines of matter suspended in a void.

Beneath his boots, the earth renders as layers of translucent mist. Through the ghost-soil, the 'Founders Resonance' ignites. It starts as a faint hum in the visual spectrum, then explodes into a complex, luminous architectural schematic overlaid directly onto his retina.

Thick, pulsing veins of mana—the ley lines—surge through the subterranean blueprint like liquid neon. They converge on a single, buried mechanism directly below the cabbage patch.

*Click. Click. Clack.*

The solution presents itself not as a puzzle, but as a highlighted path. Deus sees the tumblers of the ancient lock burning in sequence, a ghostly combination dial spinning rapidly until it hits the critical alignment. The exact pressure points on the surface, the precise flow of mana required—it is all laid bare, vivid and undeniable, floating in the air before him like a burning decree.

Deus blinks, and the world snaps back into solid color with a thunderous, silent impact, the afterimage of the hidden entrance seared permanently into his mind.
